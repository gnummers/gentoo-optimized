   @short An abstract base class for asynchronous decrypters

   To use a DecryptJob, first obtain an instance from the
   CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
   signals to suitable slots and then start the decryption with a
   call to start(). This call might fail, in which case the
   DecryptJob instance will have scheduled it's own destruction with
   a call to QObject::deleteLater().

   After result() is emitted, the DecryptJob will schedule it's own
   destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
