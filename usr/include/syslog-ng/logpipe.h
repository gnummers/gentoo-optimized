/**
 *
 * Processing pipeline
 *
 *   Within syslog-ng, the user configuration is converted into a tree-like
 *   structure.  It's node in this tree is a LogPipe object responsible for
 *   queueing message towards the destination.  Each node is free to
 *   drop/transform the message it receives.
 *
 *   The center.c module contains code that transforms the configuration
 *   into the log processing tree.  Each log statement in user configuration
 *   becomes a linked list of pipes, then each source, referenced by the
 *   is piped into the newly created pipe.
 *
 *   Something like this:
 *
 *    log statement:
 *       mpx | filter | parser | dest1 | dest2 | dest3
 *
 *    source1 -> log statement1
 *            |-> log statement2
 *
 *   E.g. each source is sending to each log path it was referenced from. Each
 *   item in the log path is a pipe, which receives messages and forwards it
 *   at its discretion. Filters are pipes too, which lose data. Destinations
 *   are piping their output to the next element on the pipeline. This
 *   basically means that the pipeline is a wired representation of the user
 *   configuration without having to loop through configuration data.
 *
 * Reference counting
 *
 *   The pipes do not reference each other through their pipe_next member,
 *   simply because there'd be too much reference loops to care about.
 *   Instead pipe_next is a borrowed reference, which is assumed to be valid
 *   as long as the configuration is not freed.
 *
 * Flow control
 *
 *   Flow control is the mechanism used to control the message rate between
 *   input/output sides of syslog-ng in order to avoid message loss.  If the
 *   two sides were independent, the input side could well receive messages
 *   at a much higher rate than the destination is able to cope with.
 *
 *   This is implemented by allocating a per-source window (similar to a TCP
 *   window), which can be "filled" by the source without the danger of
 *   output queue overflow.  Also, whenever a message is processed by the
 *   destination it invokes an ACK, which in turn increments the window size.
 *
 *   This basically boils down to the following:
 *     * the source is free to receive as much messages as fits into its window
 *     * whenever the destination has processed a message, this is signalled
 *       to freeing up a lot in its window
 *     * if the message is full, the source is suspended, no further messages
 *       are received.
 *
 *   This controls the message rate but doesn't completely ruin throughput,
 *   as the source has some space without being suspended, as suspension and
 *   resuming action takes considerable amount of time (mostly latency, but
 *   CPU is certainly also used).
 *
 *   There are currently two forms of flow control:
 *     * hard flow control
 *     * soft flow control
 *
 *   The first is the form of flow control present in earlier syslog-ng
 *   versions and was renamed as "hard" in order to differentiate from the
 *   other form.  Hard means that the source is completely suspended until
 *   the destination indeed processed a message.  If the network is down,
 *   the disk is full, the source will not accept messages.
 *
 *   Soft flow control was introduced when syslog-ng became threaded and the
 *   earlier priority based behaviour couldn't be mimiced any other way.
 *   Soft flow control cannot be configured, it is automatically used by
 *   file destinations if "hard" flow control is not enabled by the user.
 *   Soft flow control means that flow is only controlled as long as the
 *   destination is writable, if an error occurs (disk full, etc) messages
 *   get dropped on the floor.  But as long as the destination is writable,
 *   the destination rate controls the source rate as well.
 *
 *   The behaviour in non-threaded syslog-ng was, that destinations were
 *   prioritized over sources, and whenever a destination was writable,
 *   sources were implicitly suspended.  This is not easily implementable by
 *   threads and ivykis, thus this alternative mechanism was created.
 *
 *   Please note that soft-flow-control is a somewhat stronger guarantee
 *   than the earlier behaviour, therefore it is currently only used for
 *   destination files.
 *
 * Plugin overrides
 *
 *   Various methods can be overridden by external objects within
 *   LogPipe and derived classes. The aim of this functionality to
 *   make it possible to attach new functions to a LogPipe at runtime.
 *
 *   For example, it'd make sense to implement the "suppress"
 *   functionality as such plugin, which is currently implemented in
 *   LogWriter, and in case a non-LogWriter destination would need it,
 *   then a separate implementation would be needed.
 *
 *   The way to override a method by an external object is as follows:
 *
 *     - it should save the current value of the method address (for
 *       example "queue" for the queue method)
 *
 *     - it should change the pointer pointing to the relevant method to
 *       its own code (e.g. change "queue" in LogPipe)
 *
 *     - once the hook is invoked, it should take care about calling the
 *       original function
