 * number of seconds compared to GMT.
 *
 * In concept, this is similar to WallClockTime, with the difference that
 * this represents the time in seconds since the UNIX epoch.
 *
 * In design, it is also similar to WallClockTime, the original intention
 * was to use an embedded "struct timeval", however that would enlarge the
 * LogMessage structure with a lot of padding (the struct would go from 16
 * to 24 bytes and we have 3 of these structs in LogMessage).
