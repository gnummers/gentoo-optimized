# Default configuration for non-set values
#
# As stated in sandbox.conf, any value in here do not get used if the variable
# is already present in the environment.  All rules of the ACCESS Section
# applies here.
#
# Also note that SANDBOX_WORKDIR is a special variable that is just set if
# sandbox is run interactive (ie, no commandline options), and points to the
# current directory.

# Normally the whole filesystem should be readable
SANDBOX_READ="/"

# Finally add current directory if interactive
SANDBOX_WRITE="${SANDBOX_WORKDIR}"
# Needed for configure tests
SANDBOX_WRITE="/usr/tmp/conftest:/usr/lib/conftest:/usr/lib32/conftest:/usr/lib64/conftest:/usr/tmp/cf:/usr/lib/cf:/usr/lib32/cf:/usr/lib64/cf"

# Usually writes in /home should not cause violations
SANDBOX_PREDICT="${HOME}"
