		<flag name="device-mapper">
	Enable device-mapper support from <pkg>sys-fs/lvm2</pkg> in parted
	</flag>
		<flag name="debug">
	Enable debugging as encouraged by upstream: [The default configuration]
	includes --enable-debug (by default), which contains many assertions.
	Obviously, these "waste" space, but in the past, they have caught
	potentially dangerous bugs before they would have done damage, so we think
	it's worth it.  Also, it means we get more bug reports ;)
	</flag>
		<flag name="standalone">
	Install a standalone version which provides all headers and binaries
	which collide with sys-block/parted:0. If this flag is not set,
	sys-block/parted:0 is pulled in to provide the non-installed headers
	and binaries.
