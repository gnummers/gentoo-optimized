# The package will probably be removed from the mv repository: It is
# useful only for arch users. The ebuild is practically unmaintained,
# and bumps from upstream have not been made since ages.
# Stick it in your local overlay if you really want to keep it.

# There is nothing wrong with dev-util/pyrep, but hopefully this mask will
# make people aware about the successor project dev-util/replacer which is
# probably better in almost any aspect. In addition, dev-util/pyrep is almost
# unmaintained (and really old ugly code). Anyway, feel free to unmask...
