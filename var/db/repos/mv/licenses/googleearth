Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service

   Last Modified: December 17, 2015

   Thanks for using Google Maps and Google Earth ("Google Maps/Google
   Earth").

   Google Maps/Google Earth allow you to view and use a variety of
   content, including map and terrain data, imagery, business listings,
   traffic, reviews, and other related information provided by Google, its
   licensors, and users (the "Content").

   By accessing, downloading, or using Google Maps/Google Earth, you are
   agreeing to:
    1. the [9]Google Terms of Service (the "Universal Terms");
    2. these Maps/Google Earth additional terms (the "Maps/Earth
       Additional Terms");
    3. the [10]Google Maps/Google Earth Legal Notices (the "Legal
       Notices"); and
    4. the [11]Google Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy").

   Please read each of these four documents carefully, starting with the
   Universal Terms. The Universal Terms clarify, for example, your
   [12]intellectual property ownership rights in the content you upload,
   and your responsibilities when using Google content or [13]third-party
   content or [14]when using Google Maps/Google Earth while driving.

   Collectively, we refer to the Universal Terms, the Maps/Earth
   Additional Terms, the Legal Notices, and the Privacy Policy as the
   "Agreement". The Agreement is a binding contract between you and Google
   regarding your use of Google Maps/Google Earth.
    1. License. Subject to the Agreement's terms, Google grants you a
       non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Google Maps/Google
       Earth, including features that allow you to:
         a. view and annotate maps;
         b. create KML files and map layers;
         c. publicly display Content with proper attribution online, in
            video, and in print; and
         d. do many other things described in the [15]Using Google Maps,
            Google Earth, and Street View permissions page.
    2. Prohibited Conduct. When using Google Maps/Google Earth, you may
       not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):
         a. redistribute or sell any part of Google Maps/Google Earth or
            create a new product or service based on Google Maps/Google
            Earth (unless you use the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs in
            accordance with their [16]terms of service);
         b. copy the Content (unless you are otherwise permitted to do so
            by the [17]Using Google Maps, Google Earth, and Street View
            permissions page or applicable intellectual property law,
            including "fair use");
         c. mass download or create bulk feeds of the Content (or let
            anyone else do so);
         d. use Google Maps/Google Earth to create or augment any other
            mapping-related dataset (including a mapping or navigation
            dataset, business listings database, mailing list, or
            telemarketing list) for use in a service that is a substitute
            for, or a substantially similar service to, Google Maps/Google
            Earth;
         e. use any part of Google Maps/Google Earth with other people's
            products or services for or in connection with real-time
            navigation or autonomous vehicle control, except through a
            specific Google-provided feature such as Android Auto or Send
            to Car;
         f. reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from
            Google Maps/Google Earth or any related software, except to
            the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by
            applicable law;
         g. remove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service or any
            links to or notices of those terms, or any copyright,
            trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or
         h. do anything inappropriate, illegal, or in violation of others'
            rights (including their privacy, publicity, and intellectual
            property rights).
    3. Actual Conditions; Assumption of Risk. When you use Google
       Maps/Google Earth's map data, traffic, directions, and other
       Content, you may find that actual conditions differ from the map
       results and Content, so exercise your independent judgment and use
       Google Maps/Google Earth at your own risk. You’re responsible at
       all times for your conduct and its consequences.
    4. Your Content in Google Maps/Google Earth. Content you upload,
       submit, store, send, or receive through Google Maps/Google Earth is
       subject to Google’s [18]Universal Terms, including the license in
       the section entitled [19]“Your Content in our Services”. However,
       content that remains exclusively local to your device (such as a
       locally-stored KML file) is not uploaded or submitted to Google,
       and is therefore not subject to that license.
    5. Government Users. If you are using our Services on behalf of a
       government entity, the following terms apply:
         a. Government Uses of Our Services. The Universal Terms section
            entitled [20]“Business uses of our Services” is replaced in
            its entirety with the following:
            “If you are using our Services on behalf of a government
            entity, that entity accepts these terms. Solely to the extent
            permitted by applicable law, regulation, or privileges and
            immunities, that entity will hold harmless and indemnify
            Google and its affiliates, officers, agents and employees from
            any claim, action or proceedings arising from or related to
            the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including
            any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages,
            judgements, litigation costs and legal fees.”
         b. Governing Law.
              i. For city or state government entities in the United
                 States and European Union, the Universal Terms section
                 regarding governing law and venue will not apply.
             ii. For United States federal government entities, the
                 Universal Terms section regarding governing law and venue
                 is replaced in its entirety with the following:
                 “This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted and
                 enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States
                 of America without reference to conflict of laws. Solely
                 to the extent permitted by federal law: (A) the laws of
                 the State of California (excluding California’s conflict
                 of laws rules) will apply in the absence of applicable
                 federal law; and (B) any dispute arising out of or
                 relating to this Agreement or the Services will be
                 litigated exclusively in the federal courts of Santa
                 Clara County, California, and the parties consent to
                 personal jurisdiction in those courts.”
         c. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. All access or use of Google
            Maps/Google Earth by or for the United States federal
            government is subject to the "U.S. Government Restricted
            Rights" section in the [21]Legal Notices.
