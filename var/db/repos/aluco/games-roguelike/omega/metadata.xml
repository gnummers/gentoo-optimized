		Omega is a complex rogue-style game of dungeon exploration. Unlike other
		such games, there are a number of ways to "win", depending on various
		actions taken during play. The ways you can get your name on the high score
		board include becoming the highest ranked head of a guild, sect, college,
		etc., as well as gaining the most points figured from possessions and
		experience. The game (via the oracle) may impose some structure on your
		exploration, but you need not follow all of the oracle's advice. There
		*is* a "total winner" status, by the way.
