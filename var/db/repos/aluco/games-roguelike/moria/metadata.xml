		A single player roguelike game with a regenerating dungeon, moria is the
		predecessor of angband with a full-screen, text-based, turn-based
		interface. It features scrolling maps, and an infinite (constantly
		regenerated) dungeon.

		Moria's dungeons are populated by monsters, some of which are inspired
		by J.R.R. Tolkien's books. The goal of the game is to find and kill the
		Balrog, whereupon the player is crowned King. Your player can be created
		from a combination of 8 races (human, half-elf, elf, halfling, gnome,
		dwarf, half-orc, half-troll) and 6 classes (warrior, mage, priest,
		rogue, ranger, paladin), and is measured by 6 attributes (strength,
		dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, constitution, and charisma).

		Despite the package name, this is actually Umoria (Unix moria).
