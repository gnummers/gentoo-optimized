<longdescription>This package provides solc, the Solidity compiler. Solidity is
	a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing
	smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts
	are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where nobody
	has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow to implement
	tokens of value, ownership, voting and other kinds of logics.
