The MySQL init scripts are being revamped to handle more corner cases in MySQL
usage, and migrate from the old mixed multi-instance to symlinked init
instances instead.

This does mean that you MUST review and merge the changes in the conf.d script
to the new style. For each instance of the mysql_slot_* variable in your old
/etc/conf.d/mysql, you should have a seperate /etc/conf.d/$FOO file, as well
as making /etc/init.d/$FOO a symlink back to /etc/init.d/mysql.

The following variables have moved:
- MY_CNF (was 'mycnf' in mysql_slot_*)
- STARTUP_TIMEOUT (was 'startup_timeout' in mysql_slot_*)
- NICE (was 'nice' in the mysql_slot_* array)

All other items from the mysql_slot_* variable array should be merged to form
the new MY_ARGS variable.

Lastly, the new init scripts allow more flexibility in init dependency
ordering. Please see the rc_* variables in the new conf.d file for more
details.
