As of now the D compilers dmd and ldc2 will be installed into
'/usr/lib/{dmd,ldc2}/$version' instead of '/opt/{dmd,ldc2}-$version'.

Your currently installed versions of dmd and ldc2 wont work as host
compilers until they have been reinstalled. This almost certainly
means that you have to bootstrap your recent dmd or ldc2 host
compiler again with an older version written in C++, like ldc2-0.17
or dmd-2.067.
