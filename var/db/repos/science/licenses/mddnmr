DESCRIPTION 
MddNMR is a program for processing uniformly and non-uniformly sampled (sparse) NMR spectra. 
The following is legal information pertaining to the use of the MddNMR program. It applies to all MddNMR source files, executable (binary) files, configuration and documentation files contained in the official MddNMR archives. (Certain portions refer to custom versions of the software, there are specific rules listed below for these versions also.) All of these are referred to here as "the software".

CUSTOM VERSIONS
With a separate agreement a user may be granted the privilege to modify and compile the source for their own use in any fashion they see fit. What you do with the software in your home or lab is your business, however, in such cases the activity is usually limited by the agreement or defined by the collaborative project. If the user wishes to distribute a modified version of the software, documentation or other parts of the package (here after referred to as a "custom version") they must follow the guidelines listed below. These guidelines have been established to promote the growth of MddNMR and prevent difficulties for users and developers alike. Please follow them carefully for the benefit of all concerned when creating a custom version. You may not incorporate any portion of the MddNMR source code in any software other than a custom version of MddNMR without the explicit permission of the copyright holders. However authors who contribute source to MddNMR may still retain all rights to use their contributed code for any purpose as described below. The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to the MddNMR authors, but the authors are in no way required to utilize these enhancements or fixes. By sending material to the authors, the contributor asserts that he owns the materials or has the right to distribute these materials. He authorizes the MddNMR authors to use the materials any way they like. The contributor still retains rights to the donated material, but by donating you grant equal rights to the MddNMR authors. The MddNMR authors don't have to use the material, but if we do, you do not acquire any rights related to MddNMR. We will give you credit if applicable. 

CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF CUSTOM VERSIONS 
The permission to distribute compiled custom version of the software may be granted in advance with specific permission from VO. Typical conditions include but not limited to following conditions are met. These conditions also apply to custom documentation based on our files. - Mark your version clearly on all modified files stating this to be a modified and unofficial version. - Make all of your modifications to MddNMR freely and publicly   available. - Include clear and obvious information on how to obtain the   official MddNMR. - Include contact and support information for your version. - Include all credits and credit screens for the official   version. - Include a copy of this document. The MddNMR authors are not obligated to provide you or your users any technical support. 

GENERAL RULES FOR ALL DISTRIBUTION
All requests to acquire the software should be sent to VO, who normally distributes the software on behalf of all co-authors.
