AsmJit is complete x86/x64 JIT-Assembler for C++ language. It supports
32/64-bit x86 processors including all usable extensions (FPU, MMX,
3dNow, SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and SSE4) through type-safe API that mimics Intel
assembler syntax and eliminates nearly all common mistakes that can be
done by developers.

AsmJit contains also high-level code generation classes that can be used
as a portable way to create JIT code that should run on all supported
architectures. High-level classes can handle various function
calling-conventions, register allocation and 32/64-bit mode differences.
