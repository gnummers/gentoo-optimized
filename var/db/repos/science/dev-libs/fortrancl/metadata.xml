FortranCL is an OpenCL interface for Fortran 90. It allows programmers to call
the OpenCL parallel programming framework directly from Fortran, so developers
can accelerate their Fortran code using graphical processing units (GPU) and
other accelerators.
The interface is designed to be as close to C OpenCL interface as possible,
while written in native Fortran 90 with type checking. It was originally
designed as an OpenCL interface to be used by the Octopus code.
The interface is not complete but provides all the basic calls required to 
write a full Fortran 90 OpenCL program.
