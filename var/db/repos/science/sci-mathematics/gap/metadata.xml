Groups, Algorithms, Programming is a system for computational
discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group
Theory. GAP provides a  programming language, a library of thousands
of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. GAP
is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their
representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial
structures, and more.
