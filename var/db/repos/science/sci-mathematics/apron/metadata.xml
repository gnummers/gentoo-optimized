The APRON library is dedicated to the static analysis of the numerical
variables of a program by Abstract Interpretation. The aim of such an
analysis is to infer invariants about these variables. The APRON library
is intended to be a common interface to various underlying
libraries/abstract domains and to provide additional services that can
be implemented independently from the underlying library/abstract
domain, as shown by the poster on the right (presented at the SAS 2007
conference.
