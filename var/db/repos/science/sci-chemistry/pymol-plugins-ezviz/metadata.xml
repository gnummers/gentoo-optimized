EZ-Viz was developed as an assistance tool for the difficult to 
understand user interface of PyMOL. The standard interface is 
very complex takes a long time to learn, especially for students 
unfamiliar with the chemistry and busy researchers with little 
time to learn the commands necessary to use the PyMOL software 
to its full extent. EZ-Viz allows for users to navigate through 
PyMOL using a series of clickable buttons and tabs to complete 
all functions of the PyMol software without ever having to type 
a single command.
