I have been unable to track down a source repository for fits, so this
ebuild straps a build system onto source unpacked from a source JAR.
Not the greatest solution, but it's the best I can come up with.  I've
also had trouble figuring out who holds copyright and what the
licensing terms are.  If you find more authoritative information, let
me know!
