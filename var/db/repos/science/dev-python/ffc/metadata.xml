FFC works as a compiler for multilinear forms by generating code (C or
C++) for the evaluation of a multilinear form given in mathematical
notation. This new approach to form evaluation makes it possible to
combine generality with efficiency; the form can be given in
mathematical notation and the generated code is as efficient as
hand-optimized code.
