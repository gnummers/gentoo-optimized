Forthon generates links between Fortran95 and Python. Python is a high
level, object oriented, interactive and scripting language that allows
a flexible and versatile interface to computational tools. The Forthon
package generates the necessary wrapping code which allows access to
the Fortran database and to the Fortran subroutines and
functions. This provides a development package where the
computationally intensive parts of a code can be written in efficient
Fortran, and the high level controlling code can be written in the
much more versatile Python language.
