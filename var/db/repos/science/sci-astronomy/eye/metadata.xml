In EyE (Enhance Your Extraction) an artificial neural network
connected to pixels of a moving window (retina) is trained to
associate these input stimuli to the corresponding response in one
or several output image(s). The resulting filter can be loaded in
SExtractor to operate complex, wildly non-linear filters on
astronomical images. Typical applications of EyE include adaptive
filtering, feature detection and cosmetic corrections.
