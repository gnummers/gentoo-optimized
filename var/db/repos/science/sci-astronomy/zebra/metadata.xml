The Zurich Extragalactic Bayesian Redshift Analyzer is a software to
compute and analyze photometric redshifts of galaxies.
ZEBRA combines and extends several of the classical approaches to
produce accurate photometric redshifts down to faint magnitudes. In
particular, ZEBRA uses the template-fitting approach to produce
Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian redshift estimates based on:
* An automatic iterative technique to correct the original set of
galaxy templates to best represent the SEDs of real galaxies at
different redshifts;
* A training set of spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of
the photometric sample, to improve the robustness of the
photometric redshift estimates; and
* An iterative technique for Bayesian redshift estimates, which
extracts the full two-dimensional redshift and template likelihood
function for each galaxy.
