The Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library Tool Set is a set of
command-line tools based on STIL, the Starlink Tables Infrastructure
Library. It deals with the processing of tabular data; the package
has been designed for, but is not restricted to, astronomical tables
such as object catalogues. Some of the tools are generic and can
work with multiple formats (including FITS, VOTable, CSV, SQL and
ASCII), and others are specific to the VOTable format.
