Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables is an interactive
graphical viewer and editor for tabular data. Its aim is to provide
most of the facilities that astronomers need for analysis and
manipulation of source catalogues and other tables, though it can be
used for non-astronomical data as well. It understands a number of
different astronomically important formats (including FITS and
VOTable) and more formats can be added.
