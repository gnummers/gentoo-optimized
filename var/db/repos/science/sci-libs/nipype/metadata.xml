Nipype, an open-source, community-developed initiative under the
umbrella of NiPy, is a Python project that provides a uniform interface
to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction between
these packages within a single workflow. Nipype provides an environment
that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms from different
packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, Camino, MRtrix, MNE, AFNI, Slicer),
eases the design of workflows within and between packages, and reduces
the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is
creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development
in a high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline systems.
