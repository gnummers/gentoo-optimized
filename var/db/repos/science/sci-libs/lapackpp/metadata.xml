LAPACK++ (Linear Algebra PACKage in C++) is a software library for
numerical linear algebra that solves systems of linear equations and
eigenvalue problems on high performance computer architectures.
Computational support is provided for supports various matrix classes
for vectors, non-symmetric matrices, SPD matrices, symmetric matrices,
banded, triangular, and tridiagonal matrices; however, it does not
include all of the capabilities of original f77 LAPACK. Emphasis is
given to routines for solving linear systems consisting of non-symmetric
matrices, symmetric positive definite systems, and solving linear
least-square systems.
