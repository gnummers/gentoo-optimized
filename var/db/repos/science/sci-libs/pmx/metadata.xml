pmx (formerly pymacs) has started as a small bunch of classes to read
structure files such as pdb or gro and trajectory data in gromacs xtc
format. Over the years it has been extended towards a versatile (bio-)
molecular structure manipulation package with some additional
functionalities, e.g. gromacs file parsers and scripts for setup and
analysis of free energy calculations.
