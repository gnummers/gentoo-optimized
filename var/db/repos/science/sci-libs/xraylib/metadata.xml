Quantitative estimate of elemental composition by spectroscopic and imaging
techniques using X-ray fluorescence requires the availability of accurate data
of X-ray interaction with matter. Although a wide number of computer codes
and data sets are reported in literature, none of them is presented in the
form of freely available library functions which can be easily included in
software applications for X-ray fluorescence. This work presents a compilation
of data sets from different published works and an xraylib interface in the
form of callable functions. Although the target applications are on X-ray
fluorescence, cross sections of interactions like photoionization, coherent
scattering and Compton scattering, as well as form factors and anomalous
scattering functions, are also available.

xraylib provides access to some of the most respected databases of physical
data in the field of x-rays. The core of xraylib is a library, written in ANSI
C, containing over 40 functions to be used to retrieve data from these
databases. This C library can be directly linked with any program written in
C, C++ or Objective-C. Furthermore, the xraylib package contains bindings to
several popular programming languages: Fortran 2003, Perl, Python, Java, IDL,
Lua and .NET, as well as a command-line utility which can be used as a
pocket-calculator. Although not officially supported, xraylib has been
reported to be useable from within Matlab and LabView.
