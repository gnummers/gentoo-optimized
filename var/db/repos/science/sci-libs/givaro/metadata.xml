	<longdescription>Givaro is a C++ library for arithmetic and algebraic computations. Its main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of many mathematical entities: Primes fields, Extensions Fields, Finite Fields, Finite Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers, Arbitrary precision integers and rationals (C++ wrappers over gmp) It also provides data-structures and templated classes for the manipulation of basic algebraic objects, such as vectors, matrices (dense, sparse, structured), univariate polynomials (and therefore recursive multivariate).</longdescription>
