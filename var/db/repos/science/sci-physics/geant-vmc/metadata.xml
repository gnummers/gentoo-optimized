The Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) allows to run different simulation
Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input
and output format as well as the geometry and detector response
definition.
The core of the VMC is the category of classes vmc in ROOT. It
provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the
dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo. 
Geant3 VMC (C++) is provided within a single package together with
GEANT3 (Fortran) - geant3.
