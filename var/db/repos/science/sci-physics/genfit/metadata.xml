GENFIT is an experiment-independent framework for track reconstruction for
particle and nuclear physics. It consists of three modular components:
- Track fitting algorithms
Currently, GENFIT contains a Kalman Filter and a
Deterministic Annealing Filter. 
Other algorithm modules can be added easily.
- Track representations
These modules hold the data of track track parameters and can perform
extrapolations of these parameters. 
GENFIT is distributed with two well-tested track representations.
Existing track extrapolation codes can be interfaced in a very
straightforward way in this framework, using their native geometry
and magnetic field interfaces.
- Reconstruction hits
The hit dimensionality and the orientation of planar tracking detectors
can be chosen freely. 
GENFIT is especially useful for tracking systems which include detectors
which do not measure the passage of particles on predefined planes,
like TPCs or wire-based drift chambers. The concept of so-called
virtual detector planes provides a simple mechanism to use these
detector hits in a transparent way without any geometrical simplifications.
GENFIT has been developed in the framework of the PANDA experiment at
FAIR, Darmstadt, Germany. 
It is also used in the Belle-2, Fopi, and GEM-TPC experiments.
