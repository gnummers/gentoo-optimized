	<longdescription>AutoEditor is a program that can automatically correct discrepancies in a
multiple alignment by reanalyzing the chromatograms of the discrepant bases.
The input to AutoEditor is the multiple alignment in contig form, the sequence
and quality values in FASTA format, and the base call positions in
"SEQNAME basecallpositions\n" format where the basecall positions are written
in hex (4 nibbles per basecall position) concatentated together. The path
to the chromatograms for the sequences should be specified with the -c option.
More help is available with -h.

The output is to a timestamped autoEditor directory that has the input files
edited along with other TIGR specific file formats. Sample input data is
provided with the distribution in the sample directory.
