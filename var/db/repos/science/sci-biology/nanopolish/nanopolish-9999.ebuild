# HDF5 is not thread safe by default and nanopolish currently requires a threadsafe HDF5.
# This is one reason we download the compile it ourself (the main reason is to make it
# easier for most users). The other options cxx, fortran, mpi are not needed by nanopolish
# (we use the C bindings in nanopolish only).
# The bundled version of htslib in is 1.2.1 as of now although 1.5.1 already exists
