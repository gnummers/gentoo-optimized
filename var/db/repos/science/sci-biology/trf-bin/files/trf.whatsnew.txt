[newspaper.png] What's New?

New For Version 4.09 (Feb 22, 2016)

   [checkmark.png] new -l/-L flag allows the user to specify the length of
   the longest expected TR array in the input sequence, in millions. The
   default value is 2, for 2 million bp. For HG38, a value of 6 is
   necessary.

   Example usage:
trf409.linux64.exe hg38.fasta 2 5 7 80 10 50 2000 -l 6

   [checkmark.png] Setting a sufficiently high value may result in a
   crash, very long execution time, or a sharp drop in available memory on
   your system. We have only tested up to a value of 25.

   [checkmark.png] For workloads requiring over 3GB of RAM (any value of
   -l above 5), the 32-bit builds cannot be used.

   [checkmark.png] New -v/-V flag allows you to quickly check your version
   of TRF.

   [checkmark.png] New -u/-U flag allows you to quickly display the usage
   help text.


New For Version 4.07b

   [checkmark.png] new -ngs flag allows more compact output and piping of
   input on linux systems, returns standard linux exit value of 0 on
   success

   [checkmark.png] temporary output is no longer written to disk

   [checkmark.png] changed alignment to go further when score drops to 0
   on first pass, more repeats are reported now

   [checkmark.png] fixed bestlist structure deallocations, this
   significantly improves run speed on multi-sequence fasta files

   [checkmark.png] fixed line in alignment files "file K of N", K was off
   by 1 before

   [checkmark.png] Added check to make sure all required parameters are
   entered from the commandline


New For Version 4.04

   [checkmark.png] Widened radius of narrowband alignment to avoid losing
   alignment in some cases


New For Version 4.03

   [checkmark.png] Added -R switch to produce output without redundancy if
   desired

   [checkmark.png] Fixed a bug in the redundancy algorithm which sometimes
   caused repeats to vanish

   [checkmark.png] Fixed a bug when N characters being part of pattern
   cause problems


New For Version 4.00

   [checkmark.png] Improved longer period detection and period 1 detection

   [checkmark.png] Improved alignment

   [checkmark.png] Added a flag to suppress HTML output (-h)

   [checkmark.png] Fixed a loading sequence problem with incomplete FASTA
   format files

   [checkmark.png] Increased minimum period for larger repeats from 1.9 to
   1.8 (patternsize > 50)

   [checkmark.png] Added Linux GUI version (GTK+)


New For Version 3.21

   [checkmark.png] Fixed Sequence Name Bug: This bug affected the parsing
   of FASTA header on Windows versions of the program. The bug caused the
   program to report a sequence name that had a control character appended
   at the end and a missing parameters line in the output data file. This
   bug surfaced as a result of version 3.20 fixes.


New For Version 3.20

   [checkmark.png] Improved Redundancy Control: We have improved the
   program's ability to remove redundant versions of the same tandem
   repeat. On earlier versions certain conditions could cause the
   algorithm to leave a redundant version in the output. The new version
   properly identifies these and removes them.

   [checkmark.png] Improved End-of-Line Identification: Different
   operating systems use different conventions for end of line (EOL)
   character sequence in text files. We have made improvements in the
   routines that allows TRF to read sequence text from files using various
   EOL conventions.

   [checkmark.png] Fixed Memory Overrun Bug: We have corrected a problem
   where some large-pattern, low-scoring repeats could cause a memory
   fault in previous versions. Thanks to Angie Hinrichs at UC Santa Cruz's
   Genome Bioinformatics group for the bug report and the offending
   sequence.



Previous Update (Version 3.01)

   [checkmark.png] Unlimited Sequence Size: We have eliminated the
   sequence size restriction of previous versions. In this version you are
   only limited by the memory available in your system.

   [checkmark.png] Multi-Sequence Files: The program handles files
   containing multiple sequences. Each sequence must contain its own FASTA
   header. A summary page is produced which links to the results of
   individual sequences.

   [checkmark.png] Data File Includes Repeat Sequence: We now include
   complete repeat sequence for each repeat record reported in the data
   file.

   [checkmark.png] Smaller Scores: The downloadable versions of the
   program are now able to report matches with scores as low as 20. We
   recommend caution when using this feature since very large output files
   can be generated at this score level.

   [checkmark.png] Longer Patter Sizes: The program finds repeats with
   period size as large as 2000 base pairs.

   [checkmark.png] New File Naming Convention: For input files containing
   a single sequence the naming convention for output files has not been
   changed. For input files containing multiple sequences a summary page
   is produced. This file has the extension "summary.html" and contains
   links to the repeat tables of the individual sequences. In the name of
   each of those repeat tables and their alignment files, an additional
   identifier ".sn." ( n an integer, for example: ".s3.") has been
   inserted before the parameters to indicate the sequence index in the
   input file.

   [checkmark.png] Repeat Table Changes: Each table now shows the total
   number of repeats found in the sequence and links to other tables have
   been added at the bottom of the page.

   [checkmark.png] Longer Flanking Sequence: 500 characters of flanking
   sequence on each side of the repeat are now reported.


   Previous Update (Version 2.02)

   [checkmark.png] Multiple Repeat Tables: If the output contains more
   than 140 repeats, multiple linked repeat tables and alignment files
   will be produced. This will speed downloading time and overcome
   problems with tables too big for web browsers to format.

   [checkmark.png] Consensus Sequence: The program prints the consensus
   sequence for each repeat in the alignment file, below the alignment.

   [checkmark.png] Flanking Sequence: As an option, the program prints 200
   characters of flanking sequence from each side of the repeat. This may
   be useful for PCR primer determination. Find it in the alignment file.

   [checkmark.png] Masked Sequence File: As an option, the program returns
   a copy of the original sequence with the tandem repeats "masked" out.
   The masked sequence file is a [2]FASTA format file with every tandem
   repeat character changed to the letter 'N'. The word "masked" is added
   to the sequence description line just after the '>' character.

   [checkmark.png] Data File: As an option, the program returns a text
   file containing the same data, in the same order, as the summary table
   file, plus consensus sequences, but without any labels or formatting
   instructions. This file is suitable for automated processing, for
   example with a perl script.

   [checkmark.png] Select Parameters: Now you can select parameters when
   you submit a sequence, or simply use the default parameters. Visit the
   [3]Submit Options Page for more details.

   [checkmark.png] Sequence Alphabet: The program now handles sequences
   containing letter other than A, C, G, and T.

   [checkmark.png] Enhanced Alignment File: We have modified the
   presentation of the alignment file. The output should be easier to view
   and print.

   [checkmark.png] Automatic Redundancy Removal: The program now reports
   only the smallest period size for a repeat unless a larger period size
   has a significantly higher score.

   [checkmark.png] Windows Version Now Available: A Windows version of the
   program is now available for download. This version of the the program
   can be run under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4. Please visit our
   [4]Download Page for more details.
