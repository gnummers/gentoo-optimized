FASTA Format:

   The FASTA format is a plain text format which looks something like
   this:

   >myseq
   AGTCGTCGCT AGCTAGCTAG CATCGAGTCT TTTCGATCGA GGACTAGACT TCTAGCTAGC
   TAGCATAGCA TACGAGCATA TCGGTCATGA GACTGATTGG GCTTTAGCTA GCTAGCATAG
   CATACGAGCA TATCGGTAGA CTGATTGGGT TTAGGTTACC

   The first line starts with a greater than sign ">" and contains a name
   or other identifier for the sequence. This is the sequence header and
   must be in a single line. The remaining lines contain the sequence
   data. The sequence can be in upper or lower case letters. Anything
   other than letters (numbers for example) is ignored. Multiple sequences
   can be present in the same file as long as each sequence has its own
   header.

Table Explanation:

   The summary table includes the following information:
    1. Indices of the repeat relative to the start of the sequence.
    2. Period size of the repeat.
    3. Number of copies aligned with the consensus pattern.
    4. Size of consensus pattern (may differ slightly from the period
       size).
    5. Percent of matches between adjacent copies overall.
    6. Percent of indels between adjacent copies overall.
    7. Alignment score.
    8. Percent composition for each of the four nucleotides.
    9. Entropy measure based on percent composition.

   If the output contains more than 120 repeats, multiple linked tables
   are produced. The links to the other tables appear at the top and
   bottom of each table.

   Note: If you save multiple linked summary table files, use the default
   names supplied by your browser to preserve the automatic linking.

Alignment Explanation:

   The alignment is presented as follows:
    1. In each pair of lines, the actual sequence is on the top and a
       consensus sequence for all the copies is on the bottom.
    2. Each pair of lines is one period except for very small patterns.
    3. The 10 sequence characters before and after a repeat are shown.
    4. Symbol * indicates a mismatch.
    5. Symbol - indicates an insertion or deletion.
    6. Statistics refers to the matches, mismatches and indels overall
       between adjacent copies in the sequence, not between the sequence
       and the consensus pattern.
    7. Distances between matching characters at corresponding positions
       are listed as distance, number at that distance, percentage of all
       matches.
    8. ACGTcount is percentage of each nucleotide in the repeat sequence.
    9. Consensus sequence is shown by itself.
   10. If chosen as an option, 500 characters of flanking sequence on each
       side of the repeat are shown.

   Note: If you save the alignment file, use the default name supplied by
   your browser to preserve the automatic cross-referencing with the
   summary table.

Program Parameters:

   Input to the program consists of a sequence file and the following
   parameters:
    1. Alignment Parameters. Weights for match, mismatch and indels. These
       parameters are for Smith-Waterman style local alignment using
       wraparound dynamic programming. Lower weights allow alignments with
       more mismatches and indels. Match weight is +2 in all options here.
       Mismatch and indel weights (interpreted as negative numbers) are
       either 3, 5, or 7. A 3 is more permissive and a 7 less permissive
       of these types of alignments choices.
    2. Minimum Alignment Score. The alignment score must meet or exceed
       this value for the repeat to be reported.
    3. Maximum Period Size. The period size must be no larger than this
       value for the repeat to be reported. Period size is the programs
       best guess at the pattern size of the tandem repeat. The program
       will find all repeats with period size between 1 and 2000.
    4. Maximum TR array size. Specifies the longest TR array (the complete
       repeating sequence) expected to be found in the input, in millions
       of base pairs. Some sequences have very long TR arrays, such as
       chromosome 18 in HG38 which has an array measuring over 5.3 million
       base pairs.
    5. Detection Parameters. Matching probability Pm and indel probability
       Pi. Pm = .80 and Pi = .10 by default and cannot be modified in this
       version of the program.

Options:

    1. Flanking sequence. Flanking sequence consists of the 500
       nucleotides on each side of a repeat. Flanking sequence is recorded
       in the alignment file. This may be useful for PCR primer
       determination.
    2. Masked Sequence File. The masked sequence file is a [2]FASTA format
       file containing a copy of the sequence with every character that
       occurred in a tandem repeat changed to the letter 'N'. The word
       "masked" is added to the sequence description line just after the
       '>' character.
    3. Data File. The data file is a text file which contains the same
       information, in the same order, as the repeat [3]table file, plus
       consensus and repeat sequences. This file contains no labeling and
       is suitable for additional processing, for example with a perl
       script, outside of the program.
