Using Command Line Version of Tandem Repeats Finder

   Once the program is installed you can run it with no parameters to
   obtain information on proper usage syntax.

   If you installed the program as trf then by typing trf at the command
   line you will see the following output:

Please use: trf File Match Mismatch Delta PM PI Minscore MaxPeriod [options]

Where: (all weights, penalties, and scores are positive)
  File = sequences input file
  Match  = matching weight
  Mismatch  = mismatching penalty
  Delta = indel penalty
  PM = match probability (whole number)
  PI = indel probability (whole number)
  Minscore = minimum alignment score to report
  MaxPeriod = maximum period size to report
  [options] = one or more of the following:
        -m        masked sequence file
        -f        flanking sequence
        -d        data file
        -h        suppress html output
        -r        no redundancy elimination
        -l <n>    maximum TR length expected (in millions) (eg, -l 3 or -l=3 for
 3 million)

Note the sequence file should be in FASTA format:

>Name of sequence
aggaaacctgccatggcctcctggtgagctgtcctcatccactgctcgctgcctctccag
atactctgacccatggatcccctgggtgcagccaagccacaatggccatggcgccgctgt
actcccacccgccccaccctcctgatcctgctatggacatggcctttccacatccctgtg


   The program accepts a minimum of eight parameters. Options can be
   specified to generate additional files.

   The following is a more detailed description of the parameters:
     * File: The sequence file to be analyzed in FASTA format( [2]see for
       details). Multiple sequence in the same file are allowed.
     * Match, Mismatch, and Delta: Weights for match, mismatch and indels.
       These parameters are for Smith-Waterman style local alignment using
       wraparound dynamic programming. Lower weights allow alignments with
       more mismatches and indels. A match weight of 2 has proven
       effective with mismatch and indel penalties in the range of 3 to 7.
       Mismatch and indel weights are interpreted as negative numbers. A 3
       is more permissive and a 7 less permissive. The recomended values
       for Match Mismatch and Delta are 2, 7, and 7 respectively.
     * PM and PI: Probabilistic data is available for PM values of 80 and
       75 and PI values of 10 and 20. The best performance can be achieved
       with values of PM=80 and PI=10. Values of PM=75 and PI=20 give
       results which are very similar, but often require as much as ten
       times the processing time when compared with values of PM=80 and
       PI=10.
     * Minscore: The alignment of a tandem repeat must meet or exceed this
       alignment score to be reported. For example, if we set the matching
       weight to 2 and the minimun score to 50, assuming perfect
       alignment, we will need to align at least 25 characters to meet the
       minimum score (for example 5 copies with a period of size 5).
     * Maxperiod: Period size is the program's best guess at the pattern
       size of the tandem repeat. The program will find all repeats with
       period size between 1 and 2000, but the output can be limited to a
       smaller range.
     * -m: This is an optional parameter and when present instructs the
       program to generate a masked sequence file. The masked sequence
       file is a FASTA format file containing a copy of the sequence with
       every location that occurred in a tandem repeat changed to the
       letter 'N'. The word "masked" is added to the sequence description
       line just after the '>' character.
     * -f: If this option is present, flanking sequence around each repeat
       is recorded in the alignment file. This may be useful for PCR
       primer determination. Flanking sequence consists of the 500
       nucleotides on each side of a repeat.
     * -d: A data file is produced if this option is present. This file is
       a text file which contains the same information, in the same order,
       as the summary table file, plus consensus pattern and repeat
       sequences. This file contains no labeling and is suitable for
       additional processing, for example with a perl script, outside of
       the program.
     * -h: suppress HTML output (this automatically switches -d to ON)
     * -l <n>: Specifies that the longest TR array expected in the input
       is at most n million bp long. The default is 2 (for 2 million).
       Setting this option too high may result in an error message if you
       did not have enough availablememory. We have only tested this
       option uo to value 29.
     * -u: Prints the help/usage message above
     * -v: Prints the version information
     * -ngs: More compact .dat output on multisequence files, returns 0 on
       success. You may pipe input in with this option using - for file
       name. Short 50 flanks are appended to .dat output. .dat output
       actually goes to stdout instead of file. Sequence headers are
       displayed in output as @header. Only headers containing repeats are
       shown.

   Using recommended parameters the command line will look something like:
   trf yoursequence.txt 2 7 7 80 10 50 500 -f -d -m

   Once the program starts running it will print update messages to the
   screen. The word "Done" will be printed when the program finishes.

   For single sequence input files there will be at least two HTML format
   output files, a repeat table file and an alignment file. If the number
   of repeats found is greater than 120, multiple linked repeat tables are
   produced. The links to the other tables appear at the top and the
   bottom of each table. To view the results start by opening the first
   repeat table file with your web browser. This file has the extension
   ".1.html". Alignment files can be accessed from the repeat table files.
   Alignment files end with the ".txt.html" extension.

   For input files containing multiple sequences a summary page is
   produced that links to the output of individual sequences. This file
   has the extension "summary.html". You should start by opening this file
   if your input had multiple sequences in the same file. Also note that
   the output files of individual sequences will have an identifier of the
   form ".sn." ( n an integer) embedded in the name indicating the index
   of the sequence in the input file. The identifier is omitted for single
   sequence input files.

   For more information on the output please see [3]Table Explanation and
   [4]Alignment Explanation.
