CNrun is a neuronal network simulator, with these features:

* a conductance- and rate-based Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, a Rall and
Alpha-Beta synapses;
* a 6-5 Runge-Kutta integration method: slow but precise, adjustable;
* Poisson, Van der Pol, Colpitts oscillators and interface for
external stimulation sources;
* NeuroML network topology import/export;
* logging state variables, spikes;
* implemented as a Lua module, for scripting model behaviour (e.g.,
to enable plastic processes regulated by model state);
* interaction (topology push/pull, async connections) with other
cnrun models running elsewhere on a network, with interactions
(planned).

Note that there is no `cnrun' executable, which existed in cnrun-1.*.
Instead, you write a script for your simulation in Lua, and execute
it as detailed in /usr/share/lua-cnrun/examples/example1.lua.
