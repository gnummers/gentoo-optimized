Disable Merge Pull
==================

When you're trying to keep things linear by rebasing, it can be frustrating
when the following happens: 

  1. You commit to master.
  2. You push to upstream.
  3. Upstream has been updated.

In this scenario you have 3 choices. 

  1. _(not recommended)_ : force push, clobbering upstreams changes
  2. _(not recommended)_ : merge pull
  3. _(recommended)_ : rebase pull ( `git pull --rebase` )

Generally, you want option 3.

However, if you're anything like me, either a rebase or a merge occuring
during pull scares you, and you'd rather _choose_ to trigger that behaviour,
and you would not want to accidentally merge.

I do this by disabling non-fastforward merges.

This means that instead of a magical merge, or an automatic rebase, it will
simply complain that a fast-forward cannot occur, and then stops, letting you
resolve the situation.
