Upstream of KinoSearch has reworked the entire API to KinoSearch, and the
resulting release as for > 0.20 is incompatible with previous versions. 

For people who need the old API, upstream have provided a maintained legacy
branch of the API as 'KinoSearch1', which you can get by installing
'dev-perl/KinoSearch1'. 

The differences are substantial:

If you are not directly using KinoSearch, or don't rely on anything that uses
it, then you can safely ignore this warning.

As far as I am aware, there is only one package in-tree that uses KinoSearch,
which is MojoMojo , and if you are using that, you should upgrade MojoMojo to 
1.02, and after that, you should be free to remove dev-perl/KinoSearch
