### Ruby project's overlay
This includes many ebuilds, that currently aren't ready or suitable for the main tree.

This overlay is managed by the [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org)
[Ruby](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Ruby) team. Its purpose
is to experiment with new ruby packages and eclasses, and to serve as
a way to allow users to submit new ebuilds to the main Gentoo tree.

Please read our [Packaging RubyGems](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Ruby/Packaging_RubyGems) if you want to send us a pull request for a new or updated package.
