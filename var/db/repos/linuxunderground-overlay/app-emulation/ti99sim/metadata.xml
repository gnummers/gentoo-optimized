This is the latest incarnation of an emulator for the TI-99/4A.
At first it was a simple text-based simulation of the TI
(ti99sim-console) running under MS-DOS.
Then it was ported to OS/2 and graphics support for the OS/2
Presentation Manager was added. Later, it was ported to
Windows and had sound support added.
Now it's been ported to Linux and Mac OS X
and more features are still being added.
