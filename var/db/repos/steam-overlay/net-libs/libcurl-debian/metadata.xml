		Unlike Gentoo, Debian allows multiple copies of libcurl built
		against different backends to be installed simultaneously. For
		reasons best known to themselves, some developers release
		binaries linked against libcurl-gnutls.so instead of
		libcurl.so, the latter being the OpenSSL variant. Although it
		is less than ideal, real world usage has shown that symlinking
		from one to the other doesn't cause any issues so this package
		provides such a symlink to satisfy prebuilt binaries. Usage of
		libcurl-nss.so seems less common but a symlink for that has
		also been included for completeness.
