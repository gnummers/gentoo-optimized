		Podcasting is a method of publishing radio-like programs on the
		Internet.  Through podcasting, almost anyone can produce their own
		audio program, and publish episodes of it as often or as rarely as
		they like.
		
		To listen to podcasts, you need a program to download the podcast's
		episodes from the Internet.  Such a program is called a podcatcher
		(or sometimes a podcast aggregator).  hpodder is this program.
		
		hpodder's features include:
		
		Convenient, easy to learn, and fast command-line interface.  It's
		simple to do simple things, and advanced things are possible.
		
		Automatic discovery of feed metadata
		
		Full history database for accurate prevention of duplicate
		downloads and tracking of new episodes
		
		Conversion tools to convert your existing feed list and history from
		other applications to hpodder.  Supported applications and formats
		include: castpodder and ipodder.
		
		Most operations can work fully automatically across your entire
		podcast database, or they can work manually.
		
		Automatic updating of ID3 (v1 and v2) tags based on metadata in the
		podcast feed.  This important feature is available through iTunes but
		is often missed by other podcatchers.
		
		hpodder operations can be easily scripted or scheduled using regular
		operating system tools.
		
		Fully customizable naming scheme for downloaded episodes, including a
		name collision detection and workaround algorithm.
		
		Automatic support for appending .mp3 extensions to MP3 files that
		lack them.
		
		Numerous database and history inquiry tools
		
		Small, minimalist footprint
		
		Power users and developers can interact directly with the embedded
		Sqlite3 database used by hpodder.  The database has a simple schema
		that is developer-friendly.
		
		Support for resuming interrupted downloads of podcasts
		
		hpodder is SAFE and is designed with data integrity in mind from the
		beginning.  It should be exceedingly difficult to lose a podcast
		episode, even in the event of a power failure.
