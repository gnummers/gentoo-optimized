:Title: ghc-7.4 in the gentoo tree
:Keywords: gentoo, ghc, hackage, hackport, overlay
:Categories: news

A year has passed since last update from gentoo haskell team.
Quite a few things have happened in haskell land since:

- **ghc-7.2** and **7.4** were released by **GHC HQ**
- **hackage** got ever increasing ton of package bumps
- overlay got some of those updates
- cabal test suite by Thomas Tuegel became more popular
- and many others!

ghc-7.4
-------

Yes! **ghc-7.4.1** is now in main tree (but masked).
We've just finished building ghc binaries.

Thus far ghc on gentoo is expected to work on:

 **alpha**, **amd64**, **ppc**, **ppc64**, **sparc** and **x86**.

It should also work on **arm**, but you will have to bootstrap it yourself from
**ghc-7.0.4** binary. It took me 2 days of CPU time. I'll try to build proper
**armv5** binary a bit later.

**ia64** support was **not** restored yet: it needs either patching **gcc** to support ``-mcmodel-medium``
or hacking **ghc** **C Codegen** to generate less global objects.

While things generally work in overlay some **~arch** things in main tree are still broken
against **ghc-7.4.1**. Please, drop a note on **#gentoo-haskell** when
you find such one. Thanks in advance!

First of all, a lot of new names!

Mark became the gentoo developer and now helps haskell and science
teams to keep the things rolling.

Alexander not only helps us to keep things up-to-date but also
managed to tweak hackport to generate ``USE=profile`` style depends
like the following:

::

    RDEPEND="=dev-haskell/conduit-0.2*[profile?]
             =dev-haskell/stm-2.2*[profile?]
             =dev-haskell/stm-chans-1.3*[profile?]
             =dev-haskell/transformers-0.2*[profile?]
             >=dev-lang/ghc-6.10.1"
    DEPEND="${RDEPEND}
            >=dev-haskell/cabal-1.8"

It will help users get less build-time failures when they enable
profiling only for a subset of haskell libraries (`gentoo bug #341795 <http://bugs.gentoo.org/341795>`_).

I've added a feature to hackport which helps us spy on hackage updates:
``hackport status --from-hackage``.

The following (clickable) sample output should be selfdescriptive:

.. raw:: html

    <a href="http://slyfox.ath.cx:8081/i/2012-03-11-23-02-41_s.png">
        <img src="http://slyfox.ath.cx:8081/i/2012-03-11-23-02-41_s.png" width="446px">
    </a>

You can see there **leksah**, **unordered-containers**, **git-annex** and other updates.

Some upstreams don't upload their releases on hackage.
Think about it: by uploading you get more users for free, ease distro packaging
and get more feedback! Thanks!
