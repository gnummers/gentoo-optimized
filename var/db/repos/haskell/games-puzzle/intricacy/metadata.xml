	<longdescription>
		A networked game with client-server architecture. The core game is a
		lockpicking-themed turn-based puzzle game on a hex grid. Players design
		puzzles (locks) and solve those designed by others. A metagame encourages
		the design of maximally difficult puzzles, within tight size constraints.
		The client supports Curses and SDL, with all graphics in SDL mode drawn by
		code using SDL-gfx. The network protocol is based on the &#39;binary&#39; package,
		and is intended to be reasonably efficient. TVars are used to give
		transparent local caching and background network operations. Also
		incorporates an implementation of a graph 5-colouring algorithm (see
		GraphColouring.hs).
