		Provides clonesim, a clone simulator that simulates shotgun
		genomic clones, and flowsim, that takes the output from clonesim
		(or any other Fasta-formatted file) and generates simulated
		reads from them mimicing Roche's 454 pyrosequencing technology,
		writing output in 454's native SFF format.  The flowgram
		generation is based on empirical distributions derived from real
		data (although analytic distributions are available too, if you
		prefer).
		
		The Darcs repository is at &lt;http://malde.org/~ketil/biohaskell/flowsim&gt;.
