		@turtle@ is a reimplementation of the Unix command line environment
		in Haskell so that you can use Haskell as both a shell and a scripting
		language.
		
		Features include:
		
		* Batteries included: Command an extended suite of predefined utilities
		
		* Interoperability: You can still run external shell commands
		
		* Portability: Works on Windows, OS X, and Linux
		
		* Exception safety: Safely acquire and release resources
		
		* Streaming: Transform or fold command output in constant space
		
		* Patterns: Use typed regular expressions that can parse structured values
		
		* Formatting: Type-safe @printf@-style text formatting
		
		* Modern: Supports @text@ and @system-filepath@
		
		Read "Turtle.Tutorial" for a detailed tutorial or "Turtle.Prelude" for a
		quick-start guide
		
		@turtle@ is designed to be beginner-friendly, but as a result lacks certain
		features, like tracing commands.  If you feel comfortable using @turtle@
		then you should also check out the @Shelly@ library which provides similar
		functionality.
