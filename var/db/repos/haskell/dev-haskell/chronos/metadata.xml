		Performance-oriented time library for haskell. The main differences
		between this and &quot;time&quot; are that this library:
		
		* Uses machine integers where possible. This means that some time-related
		arithmetic should be faster. It also means that the types are incapable
		of representing times that are very far in the future or the past.
		
		* Provides &quot;ToJSON&quot; and &quot;FromJSON&quot; instances for json serialization.
		
		* Provides &quot;Unbox&quot; instances for working with unboxed vectors.
		
		* Uses normal non-overloaded haskell functions for encoding and decoding time. It provides
		&quot;attoparsec&quot; parsers for both &quot;Text&quot; and &quot;ByteString&quot;. Additionally, it
		provides functions for encoding time as &quot;Text&quot; or &quot;ByteString&quot;. The &quot;time&quot;
		library uses accomplishes these with the &quot;Data.Time.Format&quot; module,
		which uses UNIX-style datetime format strings. It is expected that
		the approach taken in this library is faster and catches more mistakes
		at compile time at the cost of being less expressive.
		
		* Only provides nanosecond resolution instead of picosecond resolution.
