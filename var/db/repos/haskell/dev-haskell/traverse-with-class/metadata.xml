	<longdescription>
		This is a generic programming library in the spirit of
		\"Scrap your boilerplate with class\", but with several
		improvements most notably, it's based on the @gtraverse@
		function instead of @gfoldl@.
		@gtraverse@ is equivalent in power to @gfoldl@, but lets
		you more easily write non-standard views of the data type.
