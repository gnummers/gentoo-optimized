		This library contains:
		
		*   A small specialized subset of the *singletons* library as it pertains to
		`Nat` and `Symbol`, for when you need some simple functionality without
		wanting to invoke the entire *singletons* library.
		*   Operations for manipulating these singletons and `KnownNat` and
		`KnownSymbol` instances, such as addition and multiplication of
		singletons/`KnownNat` instances.
		*   Operations for the comparison of `Nat`s in a way that works well with
		*GHC.TypeLits*&#39;s different comparison systems.  This is helpful for
		bridging together libraries that use different systems; this functionality
		is not yet provided by *singletons*.
