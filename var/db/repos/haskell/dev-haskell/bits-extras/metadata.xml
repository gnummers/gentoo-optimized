		This package contains efficient implementations of high-level bit operations
		missing from Data.Bits. The implementation is based on GCC builtins, which
		translate to specialized instructions where available.
		
		All operations in this package can also be (less efficiently) implemented in
		terms of Data.Bits operations.
		
		/Issues:/ A GCC-provided library, @libgcc_s@, is dynamically linked to
		provide software fallbacks on architectures without instructions
		corresponding to specific operations. This is currently only expected to work
		on Linux systems, and even there can lead to issues with GHCi&#39;s custom
		linker. A workaround for GHCi on a linux system: @ln -s \/lib\/libgcc_s.so.1
		\/lib\/libgcc_s.so@.
		
		The current plan for broader support is to replace the libgcc dependency with
		built-in fallbacks in C or Haskell code. This needs to closely follow GCC&#39;s
		fall-back behaviour for each architecture. Alternative ideas would be
		appreciated.
		
		Relevant Hackage tickets:
		
		* &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3563&gt;
		
		* &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4102&gt;
		
		/Changes/:
		
		* 0.1.3: Added a first test and tweaked documentation. No functional changes.
		
		* 0.1.2: Moved the &#39;Data.Bits.Atomic&#39; module to the package @bits-atomic@.
		Those operations do not depend on libgcc_s and should work wherever GCC 4.X
		is available.  Link to @bits-atomic@ on hackage:
