		New version of the Utrecht University parser combinator library, which  provides online, error correction,
		annotation free, applicative style parser combinators. In addition to this we do  provide a monadic and idomatic interface.
		Parsers do analyse themselves to avoid commonly made errors. A recent addition was the combinator @`&lt;||&gt;`@ and
		associates, which generalise merging and permuting parsers.
		
		This version is based on the module "Data.Listlike", and as a result a great variety of input structures (@Strings@, @ByteStrings@, etc.)
		can be handled.
		
		The modules "Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Demo.Examples", "Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Idioms" and "Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Demo.MergeAndpermute"
		contain a ready-made  @show_examples@  function,
		which can be called (e.g. from @ghci@) to see e.g. the error correction at work. It contains extensive haddock documentation, so why not just take a look                           to see the correction process at work, and to get a feeling for how the various combinators can be used?
		
		The file "Text.ParserCombinators.UU.CHANGELOG" contains a log of the most recent changes and additions.
		
		The file "Text.ParserCombinators.UU.README" contains some references to background information.
		
		We maintain a low frequency mailing for discussing the package. You can subscribe at:  &lt;https://mail.cs.uu.nl/mailman/listinfo/parsing&gt;
