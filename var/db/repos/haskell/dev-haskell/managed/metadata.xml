	<longdescription>
		In Haskell you very often acquire values using the @with...@
		idiom using functions of type @(a -&gt; IO r) -&gt; IO r@.  This idiom forms a
		@Monad@, which is a special case of the @ContT@ monad (from @transformers@) or
		the @Codensity@ monad (from @kan-extensions@).  The main purpose behind this
		package is to provide a restricted form of these monads specialized to this
		unusually common case.
		
		The reason this package defines a specialized version of these types is to:
		
		* be more beginner-friendly,
		
		* simplify inferred types and error messages, and:
		
		* provide some additional type class instances that would otherwise be orphan
		instances
