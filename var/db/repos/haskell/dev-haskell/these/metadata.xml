		This package provides a data type @These a b@ which can hold a value of either
		type or values of each type. This is usually thought of as an &quot;inclusive or&quot;
		type (contrasting @Either a b@ as &quot;exclusive or&quot;) or as an &quot;outer join&quot; type
		(contrasting @(a, b)@ as &quot;inner join&quot;).
		
		The major use case of this is provided by the @Align@ class, representing a
		generalized notion of &quot;zipping with padding&quot; that combines structures without
		truncating to the size of the smaller input.
		
		Also included is @ChronicleT@, a monad transformer based on the Monad instance
		for @These a@, along with the usual monad transformer bells and whistles.
