	<longdescription>
		This package (formerly @binary-serialise-cbor@) provides pure, efficient
		serialization of Haskell values directly into @ByteString@s for storage or
		transmission purposes. By providing a set of type class instances, you can
		also serialise any custom data type you have as well.
		
		The underlying binary format used is the &#39;Concise Binary Object
		Representation&#39;, or CBOR, specified in RFC 7049. As a result,
		serialised Haskell values have implicit structure outside of the
		Haskell program itself, meaning they can be inspected or analyzed
		with custom tools.
