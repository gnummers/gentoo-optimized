		To store passwords securely, they should be salted,
		then hashed with a slow hash function. This library
		uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the details.
		It is implemented in pure Haskell, with no C
		dependencies. For a faster implementation, the
		pwstore-fast package has the exact same API but is
		about 25 times faster due to its use of the cryptohash
		package, which is partly implemented in C. This pure
		Haskell version is visibly slower, but still quite usable.
