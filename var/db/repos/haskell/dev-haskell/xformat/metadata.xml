		/Warning:/ This version of the package is very experimental and the interface
		may change in later versions. I am seeking comments to improve it.
		
		This package is composed of two functions for formatted conversion between
		strings and typed values. Each is defined as a type-indexed function using a
		type class with multiple parameters and functional dependencies along with
		format descriptors.
		
		"Text.XFormat.Read" allows one to parse values from a formatted string. Its
		functionality is similar to the C @scanf@ function. Unlike @scanf@, however,
		the format descriptor is well-typed, ensuring that the output type is
		statically known.
		
		"Text.XFormat.Show" allows one to print values to a formatted string. Its
		functionality is similar to the C @printf@ function. Unlike @printf@, however,
		the format descriptor is well-typed, ensuring that the variable number
		arguments are statically known.
		
		These functions can be easily extended to support new formats and new types.
		Extension is simple: define a format descriptor and an instance of the
		appropriate class.
