		Rematch is a simple library of matchers, which express rules
		that can pass or fail. Matchers also report their failure with
		human readable output. Custom matchers can be build, and
		matchers can be combined using several predefined combinators
		or you can write your own.
		Matchers are often used in automated tests to provide expressive
		failure messages.
		Rematch is very similar to, and very inspired by the hamcrest
		library for Java
