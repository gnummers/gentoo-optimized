		The LaTeX project site states: \"LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system\". This library provides
		a bridge between that system and Haskell (i.e. it is a LaTeX DSL).
		
		Write LaTeX documents with all the advantages you already have in Haskell (recursion,
		type system, high order functions, ...), create a LaTeX backend for your own program,
		make analysis of LaTeX code through its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), find another way
		to pretty-printing values, ...
		
		See the @examples@ directory in the source distribution to look some simple examples.
		It would be good to get you started. HaTeX User's Guide is available at
		&lt;https://github.com/Daniel-Diaz/HaTeX-Guide&gt;.
