		This package extends Cabal&#39;s documentation building capabilities.
		It extends the Haddock markup language with syntax for subscripts,
		superscripts, bold text, non-breaking spaces, and images. Moreover,
		it works around various bugs in Haddock&#39;s and HsColour&#39;s Unicode
		support, making it possible to use UTF8 encodings in both source
		code and documentation comments.
		
		This package is designed to work transparently. It provides a custom
		main function that package maintainers can use in their Setup.hs
		file. In most cases, this is as simple as setting the build-type to
		Custom, adding superdoc to the package dependencies, and putting the
		following two lines into Setup.hs:
		
		&gt; import Distribution.Superdoc
		&gt; main = superdocMain
		
		For more information on the available markup, see &quot;Distribution.Superdoc&quot;.
