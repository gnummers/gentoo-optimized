		This module provides efficient functions for rendering vector
		graphics to a number of formats, including EPS, PostScript, and
		PDF. It provides an abstraction for multi-page documents, as well
		as a set of graphics primitives for page descriptions.
		
		The graphics model is similar to that of the PostScript and PDF
		languages, but we only implement a subset of their functionality.
		Care has been taken that graphics rendering is done efficiently and
		as lazily as possible; documents are rendered \&quot;on the fly\&quot;,
		without the need to store the whole document in memory.
		
		The provided document description model consists of two separate
		layers of abstraction:
		
		* /drawing/ is concerned with placing marks on a fixed surface, and
		takes place in the &#39;Draw&#39; monad;
		
		* /document structure/ is concerned with a sequence of pages, their
		bounding boxes, and other meta-data. It takes place in the
		&#39;Document&#39; monad.
		
		In principle, the functionality provided by EasyRender is similar to
		a subset of Cairo; however, EasyRender is lightweight and at least
		an order of magnitude faster.
