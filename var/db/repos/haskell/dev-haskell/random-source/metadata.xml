		Random number generation based on entropy sources
		able to produce a small but well-defined set of
		primitive variates.  Also includes facilities for
		\"completing\" partial implementations, making it
		easy to define new entropy sources in a way that
		is naturally forward-compatible.
		
		Changes in 0.3.0.6: Fixed overzealous fix in 0.3.0.5.  The people responsible for sacking the people who have been sacked, etc., have been sacked.
		
		Changes in 0.3.0.5: Renamed some internal modules and accidentally some external ones too.  Whoops.  Please don't use this version, it will only end in tears.
		
		Changes in 0.3.0.4: Fixed a typo that broke building
		with MTL-1
		
		Changes in 0.3.0.3: Fixes for GHC's deprecation
		of Foreign.unsafePerformIO
		
		Changes in 0.3.0.2: Fixes for GHC 7.2.*'s crazy
		Template Haskell changes.
