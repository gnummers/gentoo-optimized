		Reactive-banana is a practical library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).
		
		FRP offers an elegant and concise way to express interactive programs such as graphical user interfaces, animations, computer music or robot controllers. Thus, the reactive-banana library promises to avoid the spagethetti code commonly used in traditional GUI technologies.
		
		See the project homepage &lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Reactive-banana&gt;
		for a more detailed introduction and features.
		
		Stability forecast:
		No semantic bugs expected.
		Significant API changes are likely in future versions,
		though the main interface is beginning to stabilize.
