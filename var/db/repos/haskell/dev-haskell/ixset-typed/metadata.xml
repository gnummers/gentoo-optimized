		This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed
		by potentially multiple indices.
		
		Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.
		
		The package is a variant of the &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ixset ixset&gt;
		package. The ixset package makes use
		of run-time type information to find a suitable index on a query, resulting
		in possible run-time errors when no suitable index exists. In ixset-typed,
		the types of all indices available or tracked in the type system.
		Thus, ixset-typed should be safer to use than ixset, but in turn requires
		more GHC extensions.
		
		At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence
		of the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching
		from one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.
