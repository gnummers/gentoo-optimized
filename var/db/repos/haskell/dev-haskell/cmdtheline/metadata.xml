		CmdTheLine aims to remove tedium from the definition of command-line
		programs, producing usage and help with little effort.
		
		The inspiration was found in Daniel Bunzli's
		&lt;http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner&gt; library.
		
		CmdTheLine uses applicative functors to provide a declarative, compositional
		mechanism for defining command-line programs by lifting regular Haskell
		functions over argument parsers.
		
		A tutorial can be found at
		&lt;http://elifrey.com/2012/07/23/CmdTheLine-Tutorial/&gt;.
		
		Suggestions, comments, and bug reports are appreciated. Please see the
		bug and issue tracker at &lt;http://github.com/eli-frey/cmdtheline&gt;.
		
		Changes since 0.1:
		
		* More type safety: Types in CmdTheLine.Arg have been made more explicit to
		disalow unwanted behavior.  Positional argument information and optional
		argument information are distinguished from each other.  As well 'Arg's must
		be transformed into 'Term' before use, as some operations make since to
		perform on 'Arg' but not on 'Term'.
		
		* ArgVal has only one method: 'parser' and 'pp' have been fused into a tuple, so
		that instantiation of 'ArgVal' can be simplified for all parties.
		
		* Err is an instance of MonadIO:  The 'Err' monad now supports IO action.
		
		* File and Directory path validation:  Taking advantage of new 'Err'
		capabilities, the library provides new functions for validating 'String's
		inside of 'Term's as being valid\/existent file\/directory paths.
		
		Changes since 0.2.0:
		
		* Test friendly 'unwrap' functions:  To allow the testing of terms, there are
		now two new functions exported with System.Console.CmdTheLine.Term, 'unwrap'
		and 'unwrapChoice'.  As well a datatype representing cause of early exit,
		'EvalExit' is exported.
