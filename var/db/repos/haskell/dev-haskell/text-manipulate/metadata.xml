	<longdescription>
		Manipulate identifiers and structurally non-complex pieces
		of text by delimiting word boundaries via a combination of whitespace,
		control-characters, and case-sensitivity.
		
		Has support for common idioms like casing of programmatic variable names,
		taking, dropping, and splitting by word, and modifying the first character
		of a piece of text.
		
		/Caution:/ this library makes heavy use of the &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text text&gt;
		library&#39;s internal loop optimisation framework. Since internal modules are not
		guaranteed to have a stable API there is potential for build breakage when
		the text dependency is upgraded. Consider yourself warned!
