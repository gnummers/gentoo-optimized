		This package only exports definitions from the \&quot;mtl\&quot; and \&quot;transformers\&quot;
		libraries.
		Unlike every module of \&quot;mtl\&quot; it does not reexport
		@Control.Monad@ and @Control.Monad.Fix@.
		
		In combination with the &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-prelude &quot;base-prelude&quot;&gt; library,
		this should give you a quite rich prelude.
		
		The @2.*@ versions are restricted by
		the feature set of @mtl-2.2@ and @transformers-0.4@,
		however they provide support for newer versions of those libraries as well.
