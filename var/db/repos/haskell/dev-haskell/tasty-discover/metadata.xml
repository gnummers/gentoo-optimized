		Automatic test discovery and runner for the tasty framework.
		Prefix your test case names and tasty-discover will discover, collect and run them. All popular test libraries are covered. Configure once and then just write your tests. Avoid forgetting to add test modules to your Cabal/Hpack files. Tasty ingredients are included along with various configuration options for different use cases. Please see the `README.md` below for how to get started.
