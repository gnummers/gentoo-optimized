		'hdevtools' is a backend for text editor plugins, to allow for things such as
		syntax and type checking of Haskell code, and retrieving type information, all
		directly from within your text editor.
		
		The advantage that 'hdevtools' has over competitors, is that it runs silently
		in a persistent background process, and therefore is able to keeps all of your
		Haskell modules and dependent libraries loaded in memory. This way, when you
		change only a single source file, only it needs to be reloaded and rechecked,
		instead of having to reload everything.
		
		This makes 'hdevtools' very fast for checking syntax and type errors (runs just
		as fast as the ':reload' command in GHCi).
		
		In fact, syntax and type checking is so fast, that you can safely enable auto
		checking on every save. Even for huge projects, checking is nearly instant.
		
		Once you start using 'hdevtools' and you get used to having your errors shown
		to you instantly (without having to switch back and forth between GHCi and your
		editor), and shown directly on your code, in your editor (without having to
		wait forever for GHC to run) you will wonder how you ever lived without it.
		
		In addition to checking Haskell source code for errors, 'hdevtools' has tools
		for getting info about identifiers, and getting type information for snippets
		of code.
