		This library provides the ability to coordinate the remote ssh
		execution of commands on target nodes and display the results in a
		console interface.  The console interface can either be a cmdline
		(CLI) or a text interface (TUI), based on brick and vty; support is
		provided for extension to other UI components as well.
		
		Almost all of the functionality is provided in the library itself;
		it just needs an executable that will invoke it with the set of
		remote nodes.  See the &#39;GetRemotes.hs&#39; file for an example: remotes
		can be of any type that is an instance of @WorkEntry@ with an
		associated @WorkGroup@ grouping.
		
		There is an onrmttest executable built that showcases the
		functionality using ssh operations to localhost, and a
		corresponding onrmttestline executable that provides a simple CLI.
