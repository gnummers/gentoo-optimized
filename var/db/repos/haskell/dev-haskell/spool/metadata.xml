		This library allows conversion between the types from @Data.ByteString@
		(package @bytestring@) and @Data.Vector.Storable@ (package @vector@) without
		copying the underlying data.  This is useful, for example, when @ByteString@
		IO produces or consumes vectors of numbers in native byte order.
		
		This trick relies on the fact that @ByteString@ and @Vector@ use their
		respective @ForeignPtr@s in compatible ways.  It works with
		@bytestring-0.9.1.10@ and @vector-0.9@ on GHC 7.0.  It may break with future
		releases of these packages.  Depending on this library should be seen as a
		way to document and standardize an existing hack, and not as an absolute
		guarantee of correct behavior.
