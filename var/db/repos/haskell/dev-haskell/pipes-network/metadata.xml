		Use network sockets together with the @pipes@ library.
		
		This package is organized using the following namespaces:
		
		* "Pipes.Network.TCP" exports pipes and utilities for using TCP connections in
		a streaming fashion.
		
		* "Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe" subsumes "Pipes.Network.TCP", exporting pipes and
		functions that allow you to safely establish new TCP connections within a
		pipeline using the @pipes-safe@ facilities. You only need to use this module
		if you want to safely acquire and release operating system resources within a
		pipeline.
		
		See the @changelog@ file in the source distribution to learn about any
		important changes between version.
