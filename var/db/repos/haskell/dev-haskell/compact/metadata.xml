		This package provides user-facing APIs for working with
		&quot;compact regions&quot;, which hold a fully evaluated Haskell object graph.
		These regions maintain the invariant that no pointers live inside the struct
		that point outside it, which ensures efficient garbage collection without
		ever reading the structure contents (effectively, it works as a manually
		managed &quot;oldest generation&quot; which is never freed until the whole is
		released).
		This package is currently highly experimental, but we hope it may
		be useful to some people.  It is GHC 8.2 only.  The bare-bones library
		that ships with GHC is ghc-compact.
