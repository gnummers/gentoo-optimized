		This package provides quite simple (but not too simple) API for
		compilation of &lt;http://sass-lang.com/ Sass&gt; code. It uses
		&lt;http://libsass.org libsass&gt; (hlibsass) underneath, so the code it
		parses/generates should be compatible with original Sass implementation (or at
		least &lt;http://libsass.org/#sassc sassc&gt;).
		This package tries to minimize C API usage, so the only place where it is used
		is in the &#39;compileFile&#39; / &#39;compileString&#39; methods. This allows us to stay pure
		as long as we can and not waste performance for going back and forth.
		If you feel that compilation options constrain you too much, you may use rest
		of modules without it. With them, you can use Haskell types and mechanisms to
		manage libsass&#39;s data(eg. importers, options, values) and modify compilation
		process as you like.
