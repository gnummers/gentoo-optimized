		PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good
		algorithms for random number generation with better-than-typical
		cryptographic security. See http://http://www.pcg-random.org for more
		information.
		
		This library implements bindings to the standard C implementation.
		This includes the standard, unique, fast and single variants in the
		pcg family. There is a pure implementation that can be used as a
		generator with the random package as well as a faster primitive api
		that includes functions for generating common types.
		
		The generators in this module are suitable for use in parallel but
		make sure threads don't share the same generator or things will go
		horribly wrong.
