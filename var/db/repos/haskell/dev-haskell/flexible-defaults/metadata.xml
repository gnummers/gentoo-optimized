		Template Haskell code to implement default implementations
		for type-class functions based on which functions are
		already implemented.  Currently extremely crude but
		still fairly effective.
		
		When defining a type class with many functions, each
		of which can be implemented based on arbitrary subsets
		of the others, the standard default-implementation
		concept breaks down quite badly.  This library provides
		a system by which more complex rules can be described
		for choosing default implementations based on which
		ones the user supplies.  These implementations can
		additionally be given \"suitability scores\", so that
		when multiple possible choices could be made, the
		library can choose the \"best\" one.
		
		Changes in 0.0.1.0: Updated for Template Haskell changes
		in GHC 7.6
		
		Changes in v0.0.0.3:  Added a hack to fix under GHC 7.2.
		
		Changes in v0.0.0.2:  Nothing at all except setting
		'buildable: False' under GHC 7.2.1.
