		Byline simplifies writing interactive terminal applications by
		building upon @ansi-terminal@ and @haskeline@.  This makes it
		possible to print messages and prompts that include terminal escape
		sequences such as colors that are automatically disabled when
		standard input is a file.  It also means that Byline works on both
		POSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.

		The primary features of Byline include printing messages, prompting
		for input, and generating custom menus.  It was inspired by the
		@highline@ Ruby library and the @terminal@ library by Craig Roche.
