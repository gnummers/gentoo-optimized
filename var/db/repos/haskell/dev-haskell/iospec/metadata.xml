		This package consists of several modules, that give a
		pure specification of functions in the IO monad:
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.Fork": a pure specification of
		'forkIO'.
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.IORef": a pure specification of most
		functions that create and manipulate on 'IORefs'.
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.MVar": a pure specification of most
		functions that create and manipulate and 'MVars'.
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.STM": a pure specification of
		'atomically' and the 'STM' monad.
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.Teletype": a pure specification of
		'getChar', 'putChar', and several related
		Prelude functions.
		
		Besides these modules containing the specifications,
		there are a few other important modules:
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.Types": defines the 'IOSpec' type and
		several amenities.
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.VirtualMachine": defines a virtual
		machine on which to execute pure specifications.
		
		* "Test.IOSpec.Surrogate": a drop-in replacement for
		the other modules. Import this and recompile your
		code once you've finished testing and debugging.
		
		There are several well-documented examples included
		with the source distribution.
