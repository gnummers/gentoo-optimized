		In many cases, it is useful (either for error checking or documentation
		reasons) to define input and output types as having a particular unit of
		time. In addition, by creating a type class defining type units, this
		library should make it easier to separate the units of time the developer
		wants to think in versus the units of time the library author wants to
		think in.
