	Allow multiple hidden clocks, resets, and enables to be used. This is an
	experimental feature, possibly triggering confusing error messages. By
	default, it is enabled on development versions of Clash and disabled on
	releases.

		<flag name="super-strict">
	Use `deepseqX` (instead of `seqX`) in register-like constructs. This can
	help to eliminate space leaks when using lazy data structures in
	registers-like constructs. This potentially slows down Clash hardware
	simulation.

		CλaSH (pronounced 'clash') is a functional hardware description language that
		borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language
		Haskell. The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to
		low-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.
		
		Features of CλaSH:
		
		* Strongly typed, but with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both
		safe and fast prototyping using concise descriptions.
		
		* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all
		your component without needing to setup a test bench.
		
		* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are
		fully parametric by default.
		
		* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called
		@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.
		
		* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.
		
		
		This package provides:
		
		* Prelude library containing datatypes and functions for circuit design
		
		To use the library:
		
		* Import &quot;Clash.Prelude&quot;
		
		* Alternatively, if you want to explicitly route clock and reset ports,
		for more straightforward multi-clock designs, you can import the
		&quot;Clash.Explicit.Prelude&quot; module. Note that you should not import
		&quot;Clash.Prelude&quot; and &quot;Clash.Explicit.Prelude&quot; at the same time as they
		have overlapping definitions.
		
		A preliminary version of a tutorial can be found in &quot;Clash.Tutorial&quot;, for a
		general overview of the library you should however check out &quot;Clash.Prelude&quot;.
		Some circuit examples can be found in &quot;Clash.Examples&quot;.
