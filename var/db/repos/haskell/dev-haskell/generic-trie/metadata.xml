		This type implements maps where the keys are themselves
		complex structured data.  For example, the keys may be
		the abstract syntax trees for a programming language.
		The map is implemented as a trie, so common parts of the
		keys will be shared in the representation.  The library
		provides a generic implementation of the data structure,
		so values of types that have support for &#39;Generic&#39; may
		be automatically used as keys in the map.
