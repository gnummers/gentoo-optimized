		The &quot;Numeric.FastMath&quot; module brings into scope many unsafe @RULES@ for
		&#39;Float&#39;s and &#39;Double&#39;s that can greatly improve run time performance.
		It is roughly equivalent to gcc\&#39;s @-ffast-math@ compiler flag.
		Optimisation (at least @-O1@) must be enabled for any @RULES@ to take effect.
		
		These rules are unsafe because they don&#39;t strictly adhere to the
		IEEE-754 regulations and may subtly change the results of your numeric computations.
		See the &lt;http://github.com/liyang/fast-math/ README&gt; on github for more details.
