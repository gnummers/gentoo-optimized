		This library generates singleton types, promoted functions, and singleton
		functions using Template Haskell. It is useful for programmers who wish
		to use dependently typed programming techniques. The library was originally
		presented in /Dependently typed programming with singletons/, submitted
		to the Haskell Symposium, 2012.
		(&lt;http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf&gt;)
		As of this release date, Haddock was not able to properly process the code
		and produce documentation. Hence, all of the documentation is in the
		README file distributed with the package. This README is also accessible
		from the project home page.
