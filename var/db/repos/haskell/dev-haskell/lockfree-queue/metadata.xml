		Michael and Scott queues are described in their PODC 1996 paper:
		
		&lt;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=248052.248106&gt;
		
		These are single-ended concurrent queues based on a singlly linked
		list and using atomic CAS instructions to swap the tail pointers.
		As a well-known efficient algorithm they became the basis for Java's
		@ConcurrentLinkedQueue@.
