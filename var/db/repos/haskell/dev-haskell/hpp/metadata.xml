		@hpp@ is a Haskell pre-processor that is also a
		C89/C90-compatible pre-processor (with the addition of a
		@--cpp@ flag). It is packaged as both a library and
		an executable.
		
		To use as a Haskell preprocessor for resolving @#ifdef@
		conditionals and simple macro expansion while still
		allowing multi-line string literals, an invocation might
		look like,
		
		@
		hpp -DDEBUG Foo.hs
		@
		
		To use as a C preprocessor, an invocation might look
		like,
		
		@
		hpp -DDEBUG --cpp foo.c
		@
		
		To have GHC use @hpp@ as the C pre-processor, add this
		line to the top of a Haskell source file that makes use
		of the @CPP@ @LANGUAGE@ pragma.
