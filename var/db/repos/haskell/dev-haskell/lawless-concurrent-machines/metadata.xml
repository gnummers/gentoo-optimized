		A simple use-case for this library is to run the stages
		of a pipelined streaming computation concurrently. If
		data is streaming through multiple processing stages, you
		might build a machine like
		
		@
		step1 &gt;~&gt; step2 &gt;~&gt; step3
		@
		
		The @&gt;~&gt;@ operator connects the machines on
		either side with a one-element buffer. This means that
		data is pulled from upstream sources eagerly (perhaps
		pulling one more value than will be consumed by
		downstream), but it also means that each stage can be
		working simultaneously, increasing throughput of the
		entire pipeline.
		
		A few small examples are available in the @examples@
		directory of the source repository.
		
		NOTE: This is a temporary fork until concurrent-machines
		0.3.1 is released.
