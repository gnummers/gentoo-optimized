		Contains renderers and parsers for both XML and HTML 5
		document fragments, which share data structures wo that
		it's easy to work with both.  Document fragments are bits
		of documents, which are not constrained by some of the
		high-level structure rules (in particular, they may
		contain more than one root element).
		
		Note that this is not a compliant HTML 5 parser.  Rather,
		it is a parser for HTML 5 compliant documents.  It does not
		implement the HTML 5 parsing algorithm, and should
		generally be expected to perform correctly only on
		documents that you trust to conform to HTML 5.  This is
		not a suitable library for implementing web crawlers or
		other software that will be exposed to documents from
		outside sources.  The result is also not the HTML 5
		node structure, but rather something closer to the physical
		structure.  For example, omitted start tags are not
		inserted (and so, their corresponding end tags must also be
		omitted).
