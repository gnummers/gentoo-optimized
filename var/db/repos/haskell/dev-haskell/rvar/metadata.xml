		Random number generation based on modeling random
		variables by an abstract type ('RVar') which can be
		composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
		either monadic or \"pure\" styles.
		
		The primary purpose of this library is to support
		defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
		random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
		but performance is an important goal too.
		
		In my testing, I have found it capable of speed
		comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
		a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of
		the same algorithms.
		
		Changes in 0.2.0.1:  Version bump for transformers
		dependency.
