		Changes from 0.8 to 0.9
		
		* Removed &#39;identity&#39; from the Interned class, to support applications where the identity is obtained by other means (e.g. a unique Ptr value)
		
		Changes from 0.7 to 0.8
		
		* Disabled cache removal as it was causing problems on large data sets. There is no good way to ensure that both references remain alive long enough to finish comparisons.
		* Switched to IORef from MVar
		
		Changes from 0.6 to 0.7
		
		* Fixed problem where comparisons could happen between data structures while one was still a thunk, leading to equal structures comparing as inequal in limited circumstances, by appropriately using strictness annotations.
		
		Efficient hash-consing for arbitrary data types
		
		Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.6
		
		* Widened the caches so they don&#39;t go through a single MVar per type. This has made a dramatic impact on performance. However, this broke the previous invariant that newer entries always had higher Ids than older entries.
		
		Changes from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2
		
		* Added Data.Interned.IntSet
