		In mathematics, a lattice is a partially ordered set in which every two
		elements @x@ and @y@ have a unique supremum (also called a least upper bound, join, or @x /\\ y@)
		and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound, meet, or @x \\/ y@).
		
		This package provide type-classes for different lattice types, as well
		as a class for the partial order.
