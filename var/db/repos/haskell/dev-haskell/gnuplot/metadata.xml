		This is a wrapper to gnuplot
		which lets you create 2D and 3D plots.
		
		Start a simple session with @make ghci@.
		This loads the module "Graphics.Gnuplot.Simple"
		which is ready for use in GHCi.
		It does not address all fancy gnuplot features
		in order to stay simple.
		For more sophisticated plots,
		especially batch generated graphics,
		I recommend "Graphics.Gnuplot.Advanced".
		This module contains also an overview
		of the hierarchy of objects.
		
		Examples for using this interface can be found in the "Demo" module.
		In order to compile this and install an example data file,
		use the Cabal flag @buildExamples@:
		
		&gt; $ cabal install -fbuildExamples gnuplot
		
		With the Cabal flags executePipe and executeShell
		you can switch to more convenient
		but probably less portable ways
		of feeding gnuplot with a script.
