		clckwrks (pronounced, clockworks) aims to compete
		directly with popular PHP-based blogging and CMS
		platforms. Clckwrks aims to support one-click
		installation of plugins and themes. End users
		should be able to use it with zero Haskell
		knowledge. Haskell developers can extend clckwrks
		by creating new plugins or by building sites
		around the existing clckwrks core and plugins.
		
		clckwrks is still in very early development. Not all features have been implement yet.
