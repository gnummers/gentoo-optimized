		After GHC 7.2 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but was
		not yet exposed in Data.IORef.  This package fills that gap until
		such a time as Data.IORef obsoletes it.
		
		Further, in addition to exposing native Haskell CAS operations, this
		package contains \"mockups\" that imititate the same functionality
		using either atomicModifyIORef and unsafe pointer equality (in
		@Data.CAS.Fake@) or using foreign functions (@Data.CAS.Foreign@).
		These alternatives are useful for debugging.
		
		Note that the foreign option does not operate on IORefs and so is
		directly interchangeable with `Data.CAS` and `Data.CAS.Fake` only if
		the interface in `Data.CAS.Class` is used.
