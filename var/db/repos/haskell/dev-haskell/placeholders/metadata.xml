		While working on some Haskell code, it is often useful to
		work incrementally by inserting @undefined@ as a
		placeholder for missing code.
		
		This library provides placeholders that produce better
		messages when evaluated at run-time and also generate
		compile-time warnings so that they do not get forgotten
		so easily.
		For details, see &lt;http://github.com/ahammar/placeholders&gt;
