		According to
		&lt;https://github.com/nikita-volkov/bytestring-builders-benchmark the competition benchmarks&gt;,
		this library provides on average the fastest builder of strict bytestrings.
		
		Practical benchmarks have proven it to be highly performant as well.
		The encoders from the \&quot;postgresql-binary\&quot; library have shown
		a stable performance improvement by factors of up to 10 after the migration
		from the standard builder to \&quot;bytestring-strict-builder\&quot;.
