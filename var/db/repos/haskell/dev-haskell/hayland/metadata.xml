		This package contains bindings to the Wayland library, which is used to interface display devices, drawable clients, and window managers.
		
		Wayland exposes a "fixed" set of functions, and additionally generates a part of its API from a "protocol" file.
		This package locates that protocol file using pkg-config.
		
		If you want to interface with other protocols (such as Weston's), refer to the readme for instructions.
