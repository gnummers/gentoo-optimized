		LMDB is a read-optimized Berkeley DB replacement developed by Symas
		for the OpenLDAP project. LMDB has impressive performance characteristics
		and a friendly BSD-style OpenLDAP license. See &lt;http://symas.com/mdb/&gt;.
		
		This library has Haskell bindings to the LMDB library. You must install
		the lmdb development files before installing this library,
		e.g. `sudo apt-get install liblmdb-dev` works for Ubuntu 14.04.
		
		For now, only a low level interface is provided, and the author is moving
		on to use LMDB rather than further develop its bindings. If a higher level
		API is desired, please consider contributing, or develop a separate package.
