		monky started as an alternative to conky, i3-status or similar, that&#39;s fully containing in one process.
		Also making an effort to keep file descriptors or handles as long as possible.
		monky 2.0 is the first version on hackage.
		
		monky consists of multiple parts. A number of collection modules, output modules, &quot;examples&quot; and a helper application.
		
		* collection modules
		
		The collection modules are the core library. Collection modules export a handle that can
		be used to get some detail about the system. They can be used without the other parts
		of this package, but they are designed with monky in mind.
		
		* output modules
		
		Output modules take a monky specific output type and transform it into something that can be
		displayed by some external application. That may be a statusbar (dzen2), the terminal,
		a network port, that makes it accessible on another machine, or any other thing.
		
		* examples
		
		The examples are a group of modules, that use collection modules to create the output used
		by the output modules. The flexibility of the examples varies greatly, some may are really
		flexible, some are rather static. The intended usecase is for users to create their own
		examples and use them, if they don&#39;t want to use the provided ones.
		
		Later on, I want to create something like xmonad-contrib or a collection of user examples,
		to provide better usability for users with few to no experience with haskell.
		
		* helper application
		
		The helper application is used to compile the actual output generator and can generate an
		example configuration.
		
		To generate an example configuration in /~\/.monky/ simply run `monky`.
		Then modify /~\/.monky\/monky.hs/ to create your own configuration.
		
		Modules can have two types. &#39;PollModule&#39; and &#39;EvtModule&#39;. &#39;PollModule&#39;s work by the main loop
		asking the module to generate new output, while &#39;EvtModule&#39;s block until some event is received and
		update their output on demand. Some handles are an instance of both, &#39;PollModule&#39; and &#39;EvtModule&#39;.
		&#39;EvtModule&#39; should be preferred, since they induce less load on your system.
		The monky main-loop does one &quot;tick&quot; every second. &#39;PollModules&#39; are updated each /N/ ticks, where
		/N/ is passed to &#39;pollPack&#39;.
