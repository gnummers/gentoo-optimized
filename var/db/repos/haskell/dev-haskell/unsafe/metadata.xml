		SafeHaskell introduced the notion of safe and unsafe modules.
		In order to make as many as possible modules \"safe\",
		the well-known unsafe functions were moved to distinguished modules.
		This makes it hard to write packages that work
		with both old and new versions of GHC.
		This package provides a single module @System.Unsafe@
		that exports the unsafe functions from the base package.
		It provides them in a style ready for qualification,
		that is, you should import them by
		
		&gt; import qualified System.Unsafe as Unsafe
		
		The package also contains a script called @rename-unsafe.sh@.
		It replaces all occurrences of the original identifiers
		with the qualified identifiers from this package.
		You still have to adapt the import commands.
		It uses the @darcs-replace-rec@ script from the @darcs-scripts@ package.
