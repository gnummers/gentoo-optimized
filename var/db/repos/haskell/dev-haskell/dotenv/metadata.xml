		In most applications,
		&lt;http://12factor.net/config configuration should be separated from code&gt;.
		While it usually works well to keep configuration in the
		environment, there are cases where you may want to store
		configuration in a file outside of version control.
		
		&quot;Dotenv&quot; files have become popular for storing configuration,
		especially in development and test environments. In
		&lt;https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv Ruby&gt;,
		&lt;https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv Python&gt; and
		&lt;https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv Javascript&gt; there are libraries
		to facilitate loading of configuration options from configuration
		files. This library loads configuration to environment variables for
		programs written in Haskell.
		
		To use, call `loadFile` from your application:
		
		&gt; import Control.Monad (void)
		&gt; import Configuration.Dotenv
		&gt; void $ loadFile defaultConfig
		
		This package also includes an executable that can be used
		to inspect the results of applying one or more Dotenv files
		to the environment, or for invoking your executables with
		an environment after one or more Dotenv files is applied.
		
		See the &lt;https://github.com/stackbuilders/dotenv-hs Github&gt;
		page for more information on this package.
