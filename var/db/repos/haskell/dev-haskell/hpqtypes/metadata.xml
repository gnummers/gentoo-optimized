		Efficient and easy-to-use bindings to (slightly modified)
		libpqtypes, lipq extension that adds support for binary
		transport format and composite types.
		
		Since modified libpqtypes is used, its source code is bundled
		along with the bindings. The differences between verbatim
		libpqtypes and the one used by this package:
		
		* per-thread global error structures were replaced by explicit
		passing of these structures around so that there is no need
		to use bound threads.
		
		* handlers that take values to be put into the database were
		modified to always expect pointers to objects, as opposed
		to previous situation where primitives were being taken by
		value (which was convenient if the library was used directly
		from C, but created inconsistency problems while trying to
		define bindings in a sensible way).
		
		Examples can be found in the &lt;https://github.com/scrive/hpqtypes/tree/master/examples examples&gt; directory.
