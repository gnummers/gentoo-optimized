		This library provides:
		
		* Implementations of various overloaded conditional operations
		
		* Lifted monadic variants of those operations and common boolean operators
		
		* A typeclass for boolean algebras.
		
		Feel free to send ideas and suggestions for new conditional operators to the
		maintainer.
		
		Monadic looping constructs are not included as part of this package, since the
		monad-loops package has a fairly complete collection of them already.
