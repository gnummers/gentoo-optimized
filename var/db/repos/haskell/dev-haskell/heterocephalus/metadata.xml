		Recent front end development tools and languages are growing fast and have
		quite a complicated ecosystem. Few front end developers want to be forced
		use Shakespeare templates. Instead, they would rather use @node@ friendly
		engines such that @pug@, @slim@, and @haml@. However, in using these
		template engines, we lose the compile-time variable interpolation and type
		checking from Shakespeare.
		
		Heterocephalus is intended for use with another feature rich template
		engine and provides a way to interpolate server side variables into a
		precompiled template file with @forall@ and @if@ statements.
