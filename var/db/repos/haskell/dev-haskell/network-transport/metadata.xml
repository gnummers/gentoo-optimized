		"Network.Transport" is a Network Abstraction Layer which provides
		the following high-level concepts:
		
		* Nodes in the network are represented by 'EndPoint's. These are
		heavyweight stateful objects.
		
		* Each 'EndPoint' has an 'EndPointAddress'.
		
		* Connections can be established from one 'EndPoint' to another
		using the 'EndPointAddress' of the remote end.
		
		* The 'EndPointAddress' can be serialised and sent over the
		network, where as 'EndPoint's and connections cannot.
		
		* Connections between 'EndPoint's are unidirectional and lightweight.
		
		* Outgoing messages are sent via a 'Connection' object that
		represents the sending end of the connection.
		
		* Incoming messages for /all/ of the incoming connections on
		an 'EndPoint' are collected via a shared receive queue.
		
		* In addition to incoming messages, 'EndPoint's are notified of
		other 'Event's such as new connections or broken connections.
		
		This design was heavily influenced by the design of the Common
		Communication Interface
		(&lt;http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-interface&gt;).
		Important design goals are:
		
		* Connections should be lightweight: it should be no problem to
		create thousands of connections between endpoints.
		
		* Error handling is explicit: every function declares as part of
		its type which errors it can return (no exceptions are thrown)
		
		* Error handling is "abstract": errors that originate from
		implementation specific problems (such as "no more sockets" in
		the TCP implementation) get mapped to generic errors
		("insufficient resources") at the Transport level.
		
		This package provides the generic interface only; you will
		probably also want to install at least one transport
		implementation (network-transport-*).
