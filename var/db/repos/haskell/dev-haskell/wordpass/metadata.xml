		This script reads dict word lists and generates word-based passwords.
		Not unlike &lt;http://xkcd.com/936/ xkcd&gt;.
		
		Program also prints how many words have been read, and indicates estimated
		password space size in bits.
		
		Using just four words from default English dictionary of ~50k words will
		give approximately 90 bits of entropy. Lucky speakers of languages with
		rich inflection like Polish (over 3 million words) can easily up this to
		over 110 bits of entropy.
