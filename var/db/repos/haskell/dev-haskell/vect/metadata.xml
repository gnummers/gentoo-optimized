	<longdescription>
		A low-dimensional (2, 3 and 4) linear algebra library,
		with lots of useful functions. Intended usage is primarily
		computer graphics (basic OpenGL support is included as a separate package).
		Projective 4 dimensional operations, as used in eg. OpenGL,
		are also supported; and so are quaternions.
		The base field is either Float or Double.
