		Haskell Image Processing (HIP) Library provides an easy to use interface with a whole variaty of image manipulation capabilities.
		
		Processing can be done sequentially as well as in parallel, with an inherited fusion capabily, all through &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa repa&gt; and &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector vector&gt; packages. It is highly extendable, with an ability to add various color spaces or provide implementations for underlying array like custom data structures.
		
		It is capable of reading and writing a number of popular image formats by using &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels JuciyPixels&gt; and &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/netpbm netpbm&gt; packages. Being a pure Haskell library it does not require any external programs, although it can display images using a program of your choice.
