		Rose (n-ary) trees with both upwards- (/i.e./
		cached) and downwards-traveling (/i.e./
		accumulating) monoidal annotations.  This is used
		as the core data structure underlying the
		@diagrams@ framework
		(&lt;http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams&gt;), but
		potentially has other applications as well.
		
		Abstractly, a DUALTree is a rose (n-ary) tree
		with data (of type @l@) at leaves, data (of type
		@a@) at internal nodes, and two types of monoidal
		annotations, one (of type @u@) travelling \"up\"
		the tree and one (of type @d@) traveling
		\"down\".
		
		See "Data.Tree.DUAL" for full documentation.
		"Data.Tree.DUAL" provides a public API which
		should suffice for most purposes.
		"Data.Tree.DUAL.Internal" exports more of the
		internal implementation---use it at your own
		risk.
