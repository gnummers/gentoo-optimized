		This snaplet provides support for using the SQLite
		database with a Snap Framework application via the
		sqlite-simple package.  It also includes an
		authentication backend.
		
		See
		&lt;https://github.com/nurpax/snaplet-sqlite-simple/tree/master/example&gt;
		for an example project that demonstrates the use of
		this snaplet.  It implements a stand-alone application
		with a login screen that persists user information in
		a SQLite database and allows a logged in user to save
		comments.  Querying and listing comments demonstrates
		how a user of snaplet-sqlite-simple might relate
		Snaplet.Auth based AuthUsers to his own tables.
