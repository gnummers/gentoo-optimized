		This package implements functions, analogous
		to those from Data.List, to create and manipulate
		infinite lists: @data Stream a = Cons a (Stream a)@.
		It provides alternative definitions for those
		Prelude functions that make sense for such streams.
		Note that this package has (almost)
		nothing to do with the work on /Stream Fusion/ by
		Duncan Coutts, Roman Leshchinskiy, and Don Stewart.
