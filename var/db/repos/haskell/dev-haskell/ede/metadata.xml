		ED-E is a templating language written in Haskell with a specific set of features:
		
		* Logicless within reason. A small set of consistent predicates
		and expressions for formatting and presentational logic are provided.
		
		* Secure. No arbitrary code evaluation, with input data required to be fully specified
		at render time.
		
		* Stateless. Parsing and rendering are separate steps so that loading, parsing,
		include resolution, and embedding of the compiled template can optionally be
		done ahead of time, amortising cost.
		
		* Markup agnostic. ED-E is used to write out everything from configuration files for
		system services, to HTML and formatted emails.
		
		* Control over purity. Users can choose pure or IO-based resolution of
		@include@ expressions.
		
		* No surprises. All parsing, type assurances, and rendering steps report helpful
		error messages with line/column metadata. Variable shadowing, unprintable expressions,
		implicit type coercion, and unbound variable access are all treated as errors.
