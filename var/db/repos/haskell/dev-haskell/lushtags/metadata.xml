		&gt; Create ctags compatible tags files for Haskell programs
		&gt;
		&gt; Similar programs are [hasktags][1], [gasbag][2], [hothasktags][3], and GHC's
		&gt; builtin ctags generation.
		&gt;
		&gt; lushtags differs from these by being designed to have smooth integration with
		&gt; the [Vim Tagbar][4] plugin.
		&gt;
		&gt; Tagbar is nice because it deals with creating tags automatically. There is no
		&gt; need to manually run commands or keep track of tag files. Just open any Haskell
		&gt; file in Vim and the Tagbar window will instantly show an interactive browsable
		&gt; list of all the functions and declarations in the file. This window also
		&gt; updates automatically as you edit the file.
		&gt;
		&gt; The tags created by lushtags are marked with several extensions, so that when
		&gt; used with Tagbar you get these features:
		&gt;
		&gt; - Type signatures are displayed for functions.
		&gt; - Tags are properly scoped so that, for example, data declarations appear as a
		&gt;   tree with their constructors scoped as children.
		&gt; - Definitions that are exported from the module are marked as "public" and
		&gt;   appear emphasized in Tagbar.
		&gt; - Tag locations are internally stored as patterns, not line numbers, so that
		&gt;   you can correctly jump to tags even if they have moved in the source code
		&gt;   during editing.
