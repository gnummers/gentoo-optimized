		From &lt;http://code.google.com/p/snappy&gt;:
		
		LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides
		an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.
		
		
		This library provides a Haskell language binding to LeveldDB. It is in very
		early stage and has seen very limited testing.
		
		Note: as of v1.3, LevelDB can be built as a shared library. Thus, as of
		v0.1.0 of this library, LevelDB is no longer bundled and must be installed
		on the target system (version 1.7 or greater is required).
