		/Towards Haskell in the Cloud/ (Epstein et al, Haskell
		Symposium 2011) introduces the concept of /static/ values:
		values that are known at compile time. In a distributed
		setting where all nodes are running the same executable,
		static values can be serialized simply by transmitting a
		code pointer to the value. This however requires special
		compiler support, which is not yet available in ghc. We
		can mimick the behaviour by keeping an explicit mapping
		('RemoteTable') from labels to values (and making sure
		that all distributed nodes are using the same
		'RemoteTable'). In this module we implement this mimickry
		and various extensions: type safety (including for
		polymorphic static values) and compositionality.
