		An interpreter for Egison, a **pattern-matching-oriented**, purely functional programming language.
		We can directly represent pattern-matching against lists, multisets, sets, trees, graphs and any kind of data types.
		
		We can find Egison programs in @lib@ and @sample@ directories.
		This package also include Emacs Lisp file @elisp/egison-mode.el@.
		
		We can do non-linear pattern-matching against non-free data types in Egison.
		An non-free data type is a data type whose data have no canonical form, a standard way to represent that object.
		It enables us to write elegant programs.
		
		/Twin Primes/
		
		We can use pattern-matching for enumeration.
		The following code enumerates all twin primes from the infinite list of prime numbers with pattern-matching!

		/Poker Hands/
		
		The following code is the program that determines poker-hands written in Egison.
		All hands are expressed in a single pattern.

		/Mahjong/
		
		We can write a pattern even against mahjong tiles.
		We modularize patterns to represent complex mahjong hands.

		/Graphs/
		
		We can pattern-match against graphs.
		We can write program to solve the travelling salesman problem in a single pattern-matching expression.

		Aren&#39;t thsese exciting?
		We can run these demonstrations on our website!
		Please view and try more demonstrations!

		Egison makes programming dramatically simple.
		Please enjoy Egison!
