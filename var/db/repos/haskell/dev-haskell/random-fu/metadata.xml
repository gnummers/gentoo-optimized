	<longdescription>
		Random number generation based on modeling random
		variables in two complementary ways: first, by the
		parameters of standard mathematical distributions and,
		second, by an abstract type ('RVar') which can be
		composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
		either monadic or \"pure\" styles.
		
		The primary purpose of this library is to support
		defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
		random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
		but performance is an important goal too.
		
		In my testing, I have found it capable of speed
		comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
		a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of
		the same algorithms.
		
		Changes in 0.2.4.0: Added a Lift instance that resolves
		a common overlapping-instance issue in user code.
		
		Changes in 0.2.3.1: Should now build on GHC 7.6
		
		Changes in 0.2.3.0: Added stretched exponential distribution,
		contributed by Ben Gamari.
		
		Changes in 0.2.2.0: Bug fixes in Data.Random.Distribution.Categorical.
		
		Changes in 0.2.1.1: Changed some one-field data types
		to newtypes, updated types for GHC 7.4's removal of Eq
		and Show from the context of Num, and added RVarT versions
		of random variables in Data.Random.List
