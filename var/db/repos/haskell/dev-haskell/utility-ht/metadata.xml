		Various small helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions.
		Some of these functions are improved implementations of standard functions.
		They have the same name as their standard counterparts.
		
		All modules are plain Haskell 98.
		The package depends exclusively on the @base@ package
		and only that portions of @base@ that are simple to port.
		Thus you do not risk a dependency avalanche by importing it.
		However, further splitting the base package might invalidate this statement.
		
		Alternative packages: @Useful@, @MissingH@
