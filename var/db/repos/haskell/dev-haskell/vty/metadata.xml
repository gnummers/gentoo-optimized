		vty is terminal GUI library in the niche of ncurses.  It is intended to be easy to use, have no
		confusing corner cases, and good support for common terminal types.
		
		Included in the source distribution is a program test/interactive_terminal_test.hs that
		demonstrates the various features.
		
		If your terminal is not behaving as expected the results of the test/interactive_terminal_test.hs
		program should be sent to the Vty maintainter to aid in debugging the issue.
		
		Notable infelicities: Sometimes poor efficiency; Assumes UTF-8 character encoding support by the
		terminal;
		
		Project is hosted on github.com: https://github.com/coreyoconnor/vty
