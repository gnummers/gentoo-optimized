		Use Text.Markdown in a typical yesod project.
		This module contains instances related to persistence,
		even though it isn&#39;t tightly coupled to yesod.
		
		This package is different from the yesod-markdown package
		which uses the pandoc renderer for markdown. The main
		advantages of having Text.Markdown as underlying renderer
		is the much smaller dependencies and the permissiver
		license.  See
		&lt;https://github.com/pbrisbin/yesod-markdown&gt; and
		&lt;https://github.com/snoyberg/markdown&gt;.
		
		This package intentionally tries to be like
		yesod-markdown, so switching between the markdown backends
		should be easy.
