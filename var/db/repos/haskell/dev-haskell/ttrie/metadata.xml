		A contention-free STM hash map.
		\"Contention-free\" means that the map will never cause spurious conflicts.
		A transaction operating on the map will only ever have to retry if
		another transaction is operating on the same key at the same time.
		
		This is an implementation of the /transactional trie/,
		which is basically a /lock-free concurrent hash trie/ lifted into STM.
		For a detailed discussion, including an evaluation of its performance,
		see Chapter 3 of &lt;https://github.com/mcschroeder/thesis my master's thesis&gt;.
