		This package adds resource management and exception handling to the @pipes@
		ecosystem.
		
		Notable features include:
		
		* /Resource Safety/: Guarantee finalization using @finally@, @bracket@ and
		more
		
		* /Exception Safety/: Even against asynchronous exceptions!
		
		* /Laziness/: Only acquire resources when you need them
		
		* /Promptness/: Finalize resources early when you are done with them
		
		* /Native Exception Handling/: Catch and resume from exceptions inside pipes
		
		* /No Buy-in/: Mix resource-safe pipes with unmanaged pipes using @hoist@
