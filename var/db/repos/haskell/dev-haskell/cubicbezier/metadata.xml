	<longdescription>
		This library supports efficient manipulating of 2D cubic bezier curves, for use in graphics or typography.  Supported features are:
		
		Evaluating bezier curves and derivatives, affine transformations on bezier curves, arclength and inverse arclength, intersections between two curves, intersection between a curve and a line, curvature and radius of curvature, finding tangents parallel to a vector, finding inflection points and cusps.
		
		It also supports polynomial root finding with Bernstein polynomials.
		
		The module &quot;Geom2D.CubicBezier&quot; exports all the cubic bezier functions.  The module &quot;Geom2D&quot;
		contains general 2D geometry functions and transformations.
