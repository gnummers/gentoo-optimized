		This package provides a flexible record system which has some novel features:
		
		* Using record type families, the type system can be used to describe relationships
		between field types.
		
		* Record scheme induction permits the implementation of polymorphic record
		combinators that work on whole records instead of only a fixed set of fields.
		
		* Subkind polymorphism for sorts makes it possible to impose varying restrictions on
		the structure of field types.
		
		For detailed information, please refer to the paper
		/Generic Record Combinators with Static Type Checking/.
