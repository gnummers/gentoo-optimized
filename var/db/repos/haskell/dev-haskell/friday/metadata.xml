		Friday provides functions to manipulate images in a
		functional way.
		The library is designed to be fast, generic and
		type-safe.
		
		Images can be represented in two representations:
		
		* the &#39;Manifest&#39; representation stores images in Haskell
		&#39;Vector&#39;s ;
		
		* the &#39;Delayed&#39; representation uses functions to produce
		images pixels. These images can be combined to produce
		complex transformations. By some inlining, Haskell
		compilers are able to produce fast algorithms by
		removing intermediate structures.
		
		The library currently support four color spaces: RGB,
		RGBA, HSV and gray-scale images.
		
		Please read our
		&lt;https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday/blob/master/README.md README&gt;
		to get a detailed usage and some examples.
