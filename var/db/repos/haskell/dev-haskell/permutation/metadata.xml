		This library includes data types for storing permutations and
		combinations.  It implements pure and impure types, the latter of
		which can be modified in-place.  The library uses aggressive
		inlining and MutableByteArray#s internally, so it is very
		efficient.
		
		The main utility of the library is converting between the linear
		representation of a permutation and a sequence of swaps.  This
		allows, for instance, applying a permutation or its inverse
		to an array with O(1) memory use.
		
		Much of the interface for the library is based on the permutation
		and combination functions in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
