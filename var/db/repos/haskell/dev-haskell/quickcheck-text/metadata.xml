	<longdescription>
		The usual Arbitrary instance for Text
		(in
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-instances quickcheck-instances&gt;)
		only has single-byte
		instances and so isn&#39;t an ideal representation of a valid UTF-8
		character. This package has generators for one-, two- and three-byte
		UTF-8 characters (all that are currently in use).
