		GUI applications on Mac OSX must be run as application /bundles/;
		these wrap an executable in a particular directory structure which
		can also carry resources such as icons, program metadata, other
		binaries, and copies of shared libraries.
		This package provides Cabal support for creating such application
		bundles.
		For more information about OSX application bundles, look for the
		/Bundle Programming Guide/ on the /Apple Developer Connection/
		website, &lt;http://developer.apple.com/&gt;.
