		'RDF for Haskell' is a library for working with RDF in Haskell.
		At present it includes parsers and serializers for RDF in the N-Triples
		and Turtle, and parsing support for RDF/XML. It provides abilities such as querying
		for triples  containing a particular subject, predicate, or object, or
		selecting triples that satisfy an arbitrary predicate function.
