		This package provides a RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based packages.
		
		cabal-rpm has commands to generate a RPM spec file and srpm for a package.
		It can rpmbuild packages, yum/dnf install their dependencies, prep packages,
		and install them. There are commands to list package dependencies and
		missing dependencies. The diff command compares the current spec file
		with a freshly generated one, the update command updates the spec file
		to latest version from Stackage or Hackage, and the refresh command updates
		the spec file to the current cabal-rpm packaging. It also handles Hackage
		revisions of packages.
