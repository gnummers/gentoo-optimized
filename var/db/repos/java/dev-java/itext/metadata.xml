		iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on
		the fly. The iText classes are very useful for people who need
		to generate read-only, platform independent documents
		containing text, lists, tables and images. The library is
		especially useful in combination with Java(TM) technology-based
		Servlets: The look and feel of HTML is browser dependent; with
		iText and PDF you can control exactly how your servlet's output
		will look.
