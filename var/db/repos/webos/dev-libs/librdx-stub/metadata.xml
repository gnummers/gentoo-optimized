<longdescription>
A number of components within Open webOS are instrumented
to provide diagnostic reports to a remote site.
librdx provides the interface used by those components.
librdx-stub is a stubbed version of that library, allowing implementors
to create their own remote-diagnostic functionality and leverage the
existing instrumentation in other components. The rdx.h header file
specifies the routines that must be implemented to creating 
a functional librdx library.
