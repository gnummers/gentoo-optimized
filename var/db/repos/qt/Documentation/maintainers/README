Git Patches:

Since Qt overlay is a git repo, we prefer patches to be sent in proper git
format. It is easier for us to apply them and you also get all the kudos for
your work on the commit message. The following process aims to simplify the
process of creating git patches:

1) Create a separate branch for your patches
	git checkout -b for-qt

2) Write stuff and then commit them

3) Rebase your "for-qt" branch to master branch
  a) Switch to master branch
	git checkout master
  b) Update your master branch
	git pull
  c) Switch back to "for-qt" branch
	git checkout for-qt
  d) Rebase your branch onto master
	git rebase master

4) Create your patch
   git format-patch master..for-qt

5) Send your patches to qt@gentoo.org or attach them to your bug
