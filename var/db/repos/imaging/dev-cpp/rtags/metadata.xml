    RTags is a client/server application that indexes C/C++ code and
    keeps a persistent file-based database of references, declarations,
    definitions, symbolnames etc. There’s also limited support for
    ObjC/ObjC++. It allows you to find symbols by name (including nested
    class and namespace scope). Most importantly we give you proper
    follow-symbol and find-references support. We also have neat little
    things like rename-symbol, integration with clang’s “fixits”
    (http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html). We also integrate with
    flymake using clang’s vastly superior errors and warnings. Since
    RTags constantly will reindex “dirty” files you get live updates
    of compiler errors and warnings.
