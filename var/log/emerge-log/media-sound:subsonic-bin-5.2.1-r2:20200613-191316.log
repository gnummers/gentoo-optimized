 * checking 9 files for package collisions
 * This package will overwrite one or more files that may belong to other
 * packages (see list below). Add either "collision-protect" or "protect-
 * owned" to FEATURES in make.conf if you would like the merge to abort
 * in cases like this. See the make.conf man page for more information
 * about these features. You can use a command such as `portageq owners /
 * <filename>` to identify the installed package that owns a file. If
 * portageq reports that only one package owns a file then do NOT file a
 * bug report. A bug report is only useful if it identifies at least two
 * or more packages that are known to install the same file(s). If a
 * collision occurs and you can not explain where the file came from then
 * you should simply ignore the collision since there is not enough
 * information to determine if a real problem exists. Please do NOT file
 * a bug report at https://bugs.gentoo.org/ unless you report exactly
 * which two packages install the same file(s). See
 * https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Blockers for tips on how
 * to solve the problem. And once again, please do NOT file a bug report
 * unless you have completely understood the above message.
 * 
 * Detected file collision(s):
 * 
 * 	/var/lib/subsonic/transcode/lame
 * Package 'media-sound/subsonic-bin-5.2.1-r2' merged despite file
 * collisions. If necessary, refer to your elog messages for the whole
